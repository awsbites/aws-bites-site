00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello everyone, Luciano here and we have a unique episode for you today.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.640
I am currently at reInvent in Vegas and I've been here since all the week and we wanted to have the

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.840
chance to share the experience with you all and we're going to talk just about what did I do,

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.480
what did I learn, people I met, different announcements that we have seen and we maybe

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.320
want to comment on a little bit. So I hope this is going to be an interesting episode and maybe

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.200
something that is going to inspire you to look more at reInvent and maybe we'll see you here

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.080
next time, next year and we can chat together about all the different things that happen at

8
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.040
reInvent. My name is Luciano and I'm joined by Eoin for another episode of AWS Bites.

12
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.880
Hey Luciano, how's it going? So I'm curious to know how are you getting on over there? What is reInvent 2023 like?

13
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.520
Yeah, I think it's just crazy. So many people, so many activities, so many things to do. So it has been my first one so I'm totally anew but this I'm

14
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.280
totally improvising and trying to get the best of it but honestly I'm just getting by and trying to

15
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.120
do whatever happens every day without trying to plan it too much because it's challenging even to

16
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.560
try to come up with a plan. I heard that there are at least 60,000 people which should give you like

17
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.800
the scale of how busy it is. So yeah and it's just interesting even just the logistics of it is like

18
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.200
spread across multiple hotels like these big casinos and you really need to plan like when

19
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.840
you want to go from one to the other. Of course there is transportation but like it takes time

20
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.840
even to walk from one room to the next one if you're trying to attend different talks. So far

21
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.680
absolutely positive experience. I am amazed of on how many people I met and how many things I've

22
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.480
learned and new connections or also meeting people that have been connected with before but only

23
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.200
online and I finally had the chance to meet many of them in person. So that alone I think pays that

24
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.240
they experience big time.

25
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.240
It sounds like meeting people is just more of an advantage than attending the talks. I guess you can watch those back on YouTube later whatever you've missed but since you

26
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.600
mentioned it's your first re-invent. If myself, anybody else wants to go over there for the first

27
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.560
time do you think you've made any rookie mistakes so far that you wouldn't do again?

28
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.920
Yeah probably made many at this point but yeah the main one is probably trying to plan to attend talks but not

29
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.080
realize again how far away things can be. For instance yesterday I wanted to attend the power

30
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.280
tools workshop and I had to go from the Venetian which is where I'm staying to Mandalay Bay which

31
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.320
if you just look on Google Maps doesn't seem too far away and there are buses so I left like one

32
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.400
hour early with the bus from the Venetian and it got stuck in traffic and it took slightly more

33
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.560
than one hour so when I got there and I found the room it was probably like five ten minutes late so

34
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.920
not too too late but the room was already packed and they just didn't let me in so it was a bit of

35
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.320
a shame that I spent like more than one hour trying to get there to attend the workshop and then

36
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.160
I couldn't attend it. I was still able to meet the power tools team and have a nice chat after it

37
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.320
so it was totally worth it to go anyway but yeah it was a bit of a rookie mistake I should have

38
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.040
planned that a little bit better and maybe go there a little bit earlier so I think that kind

39
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.560
of stuff can happen and sometimes there are so many talks so you might not realize when you

40
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.040
create your own agenda that maybe one after the other is just not feasible because you're not

41
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.840
going to have enough time to to move from one place to the next one so someday definitely to

42
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.600
keep in mind and next year maybe try to have just a very few talks you want to attend and make sure

43
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.240
you have enough space to move from wherever you are to the to the venue where they're doing the

44
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.400
talk.

45
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.000
Yeah and I guess all the talks are along the strip in Las Vegas right I'm fairly familiar with the layout of it and I know that it seems deceptively short like you would not think but

46
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.400
it's actually like I don't know how many miles long it is but I'm looking here it looks like it's

47
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.880
almost like two and a half miles to get from the Venetian to Mandalay Bay even though you can

48
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.160
kind of see Mandalay Bay nearly. Exactly. So yeah it's pretty but still an hour it's crazy for that

49
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.240
distance isn't it? Yeah the other thing is even if you're walking right you got to go up these steps

50
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.600
and down the steps and through buildings and through casinos so it's it always takes longer.

51
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.520
I think the thing that is making it worse this year is that they just had the Formula One

52
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.480
so you can see on the roads they are still cleaning up all the setup that they add so I

53
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.040
think that that's why traffic is a little bit worse than what probably would be in another

54
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.680
time of the year. Yeah watch you don't fall into any manholes that have been displaced. I hope not.

55
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.920
Okay so you what have you been up to then you mentioned meeting people. Did you like schedule

56
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.600
a bunch of meetings with people and are you rushing around from place to place? Is it more

57
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.800
kind of ad hoc? And have you managed to get into any good talks so far? Are you kind of at this

58
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.760
stage thinking you've got a couple of days left are you going to just try and abandon talks all

59
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.560
together and just focus more on the social and the networking side?

60
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.240
Yeah I've attended a couple of talks and they can be really interesting but I would say just go to the talks where

61
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880
you really think you can get value on the face-to-face with the speaker and maybe other

62
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.840
people that have an interest on the same topic and then you can use the question time to socialize a

63
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.880
little bit because again just the content alone it's something you can consume later on everything

64
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.200
is recorded slides are available so it's not worth it to compromise the opportunity for more

65
00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.240
networking for just going and seeing something you can check out later on your own time and yeah so

66
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.680
so be aware of that so I attended one about Lambdas in rust which is a topic that I'm really being

67
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.440
curious about and been experimenting a bit. I'm surprised you didn't give that one but go on.

68
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.760
And yeah it was actually a really good talk by Efi and he is also another serverless hero and

69
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.760
basically he actually described three different ways to use rust in the context of Lambda so not

70
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.960
just building on Lambda runtimes but even just packaging a library written in rust for python

71
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.600
for instance and then just using it in the python runtime or even building custom Lambda extensions

72
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.800
with rust and then using them with other runtimes like java or not js so a bunch of interesting

73
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.160
learnings there and the conversation after it was super interesting it was actually

74
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.320
relatively small crowd which wasn't surprising because it's a very niche topic still

75
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.720
but everyone that was there was like super excited and everyone was trying to share

76
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.960
all the mistakes and all the lesson learned while trying to do this thing which is still

77
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.080
pretty new and not many people are doing so it was quite an engaging session because everyone was

78
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.800
super excited to try to learn from each other and other than that has been mostly trying to meet

79
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.560
people I wasn't really sure how to schedule all of that again because my first time here I didn't

80
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.200
know what the spaces will look like what everyone agenda is going to look like so I was just

81
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.120
connecting before the event online on slack linkedin twitter and just asking people I'm going

82
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.920
to be there let's exchange maybe phone numbers and then let's try to find some time to spend some

83
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.280
time together and that has been working out in in a mixed way I think in some cases it's working very

84
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.080
well in other cases I just was unable to meet the people because the schedules didn't really

85
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.680
match but also there have been a few interesting events organized by AWS for the heroes or the

86
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.440
community builders so being able to to attend this focused events is generally the best place

87
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.560
to meet people that more or less have the same interest and people that you might want to talk to and just share opinions.

88
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760
It's probably good to talk about some announcements since we're talking about re-invent I thought a few of them were pretty interesting there's been quite a lot so far.

89
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.720
I haven't had a chance to really try out any of the new features or services that much.

90
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.520
What about you from your position on the ground there, what have you picked up? What are your favorite announcements? We won't go through them all.

91
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.440
Yeah I think I only looked marginally because again here it you can be so busy that all the announcements at least for me become almost like a

92
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.080
second order problem like yes I like to see the headlines but I'm not gonna

93
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.760
deep dive and see exactly what's going on so in that sense one that seems very exciting it's

94
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.120
serverless memcache and it's something that people following the podcast know that we have been

95
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.800
requesting for at least two years I think it was one of our very first episodes where we mentioned

96
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.480
that it would be a nice thing to have for AWS and offer that kind of service so I'm really excited

97
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.600
about that I already heard disappointing opinions that maybe it's not really serverless or as

98
00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.680
serverless as we wanted it to be but it's still a step in the right direction I hope so I think I'm

99
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.320
going to defer a final opinion while while I have the time to when I have the time to try it out and see really what it looks like to to use it.

100
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.520
It looked pretty good to me as well because the pricing page hadn't been published fully when I

101
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.800
looked at it first. Then when I checked it looks like you pay per gigabyte storage which sounds

102
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.240
fine if you store some data in there but there's a minimum of a gigabyte and that's like 90 dollars a month already. So that's a bit disappointing as you say.

103
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.160
Okay so it doesn't scale to zero at least in terms of pricing. Okay so let's let's put that disappointment aside for a second

104
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.360
the other one that is probably a minimal thing but I think it can be very interesting and can enable

105
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.560
a bunch of interesting use cases is the API for the free tier services which I think is going to

106
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.360
allow lots of interesting dashboards and integrations and it might make AWS more accessible

107
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.120
to people like students that might be very concerned about not overspending on AWS so that's

108
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.840
definitely a welcome addition and again something that I want to play with a little bit more before

109
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.720
having a final opinion but it's great to see that there is a little bit of movement in that direction

110
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.240
where it should be easier for people to see what is actually being given for free and not fall into

111
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.000
any mistake or trap and then have some kind of bill shock at the end of the month. What about you? What did you like so far?

112
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.160
There are a couple of nice ones in the kind of serverless space like SQS FIFO throughput has had a massive increase and now you can do 70,000 transactions per second so now

113
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.880
SQS FIFO queues used to be a lot more limited in terms of throughput now with 70,000 transactions

114
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.240
per second you can theoretically put 700,000 messages through it in a second and also with SQS FIFO you

115
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.720
can now do QA drives for DLQs which was something that was missing before and then on Lambda

116
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.920
the scalability of Lambda has suddenly had another jump as well so everybody can get a thousand

117
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.600
invocations per minute after the burst concurrency we talked a lot about burst concurrency and Lambda

118
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:17.280
in a previous episode but like in most accounts that we've used in eu-west-1, we can get 3,000

119
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.520
immediately and then it used to be 500 per minute. Now, that's a thousand per minute, so you can scale

120
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.960
up really fast. And then on Step Functions, there were two announcements that I'm aware of. One was

121
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.800
the ability to be able to redrive from a failed state. I think that's a really good one so now

122
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800
you don't have to run the whole function again you can just continue from the failed step. And

123
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.840
the other thing is something we actually asked for I think when we covered Application Composer

124
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.800
which is the ability to integrate Step Functions workflow studio into Application Composer now

125
00:11:50.800 --> 00:12:00.640
that's done so they're obviously listening thanks everybody what I think you caught a lot of the

126
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.880
Adam's Selipsky keynote yesterday now there's a lot of AI as we could have predicted and I think even

127
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.320
though they're pretty impressive in a lot of ways all of the Amazon Q announcements we could have

128
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.800
predicted them as well because it felt like AWS had to have an answer to all the announcements

129
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.840
from the open AI developer conference from a few weeks ago do you have any thoughts I'm guessing

130
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.920
you haven't had a chance to try it out but have you heard from anyone is there a mood in Las Vegas on what Amazon Q can do? Is it skeptical or optimistic?

131
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:47.840
I think I spoke with a few people after the keynote and I maybe it's a bit of a bubble that I'm personally in but most people more I guess on

132
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:54.080
the developer side are a bit disappointed that there was so much focus on AI alone and they're

133
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.440
looking forward for the keynote from Werner just to see stuff that is probably a little bit closer

134
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.800
to what developers are looking for so maybe it's just a different audience there in general I think

135
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.920
it's it's impressive to see the amount of investment that was put in AI but again it's not surprising

136
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.480
that that's the main message that AWS wants to push because that's been the main message probably

137
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.880
for all 2023 and it only makes sense to come to re-invent with strong announcements in that field.

138
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.080
I've had a very brief period just playing with the Q assistant in the AWS console because it's like a it's almost a bit like Clippy for AWS console it's like, "I see you're starting an EC2

139
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:41.280
instance. I can help you with that!" I've got mixed results so far but you know we know AWS tends to

140
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.800
launch things a little bit early especially like they were it seemed like they were going to have

141
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.200
to launch this no matter what I would give it time I'm sure it will improve models will improve

142
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:57.200
anyway but I actually am impressed by the way they've integrated Q into AWS console visual

143
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:05.360
studio code AWS toolkit loads of other services like connect and quick site it must have been a

144
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.960
massive massive undertaking to get everything ready in time for re-invent so that is impressive

145
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.680
and there's there's loads more like you can you can start your own chatbot application you can

146
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.800
integrate it with your own data sources like Gmail and Dropbox and Aurora, SQL server loads of stuff

147
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.800
and it's it's an alternative which I would probably intuitively trust a lot more than

148
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.040
any of the other offerings out there because I know about AWS security and how it works

149
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.680
and I would have high confidence in it doing the right thing with my data

150
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.320
I'd be much more comfortable building like an enterprise knowledge base retrieval augmented

151
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:47.840
system with a bedrock or Q than I would with anything else and there's obviously a lot of focus

152
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.280
on code transformation as well they announced this Q code transformation that can migrate

153
00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:02.320
Java 8 applications to Java 17 applications I think in minutes now the Adam's claims were quite

154
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.280
extreme I think it was something like thousands of applications migrated in minutes I'd love to

155
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.000
know how that works and how do you even test them exactly I don't mean that amount of time but

156
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.240
let's see how it goes. I've started playing around a little bit with the AWS toolkit in VS code so

157
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.720
loads of stuff to play with there I think it's worth giving a try and I'm sure there'll be some

158
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.320
rough edges at the start but as alway.s it'll improve over time so apart from announcements

159
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.840
Maybe some advice, what would you recommend based on what you've seen so far other people to go?

160
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.400
I think in general yes it is a bit of an investment both in terms of time but in terms of cost because of course it's not depending on where you're coming from it might be expensive to

161
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.520
fly here it is expensive to stay here the tickets to the conference are also not cheap so it's

162
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.760
definitely something that you have to see as an investment and make sure that you get back the

163
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:04.240
right value from it. But I think in general, if you are working in the AWS space it is the place to be

164
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.840
to get not just the news which is something that you can get from your the comfort of your own home

165
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.400
and just watch all the keynotes and all the announcements from remotely right but more to

166
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.320
meet all the people and exchange opinions exchange contacts solutions build relationship potential

167
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.040
business opportunities also because you might meet potential partners, you might meet potential

168
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.080
customers and you might meet people that maybe you want to hire in your own company.

169
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.280
So it's definitely worth for that alone that there is lots of value and I would recommend people looking for

170
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.600
that kind of opportunities to to consider re-invent next year.

171
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.320
Okay I think you've got a day or two left anything particular you're hoping for before the end that you haven't managed to do

172
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:51.360
yet?

173
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.840
I think I'm just gonna focus on trying to meet a few more people there are other people that really want to meet and I know that they are here around and just haven't bumped into them and I

174
00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.520
really hope I can manage to do that and just have a chat and yeah just get that opinion and get to

175
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.560
know them in person a little bit more. Okay you haven't got people fatigue yet that's good.

176
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.720
Yeah I'm feeling very extroverted this week which is not my usual thing but it's working out pretty well.

177
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.240
Look it was good that we got a chance to catch up and share it with everybody. I know I'll be seeing you the day after you come back in person but you'll probably be too jet-lagged

178
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.080
to talk about your experience then so it was nice to catch up.

179
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.520
Absolutely I hope I'm gonna be making some sense when we meet but I have lots of swag to share so be ready for that.

180
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:42.720
All right I think that brings us to the end of this episode I hope you enjoyed it and I hope

181
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.480
if you have been to reinvent as well that you'd like to share your experience what are the things

182
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.600
that you learn or unexpected things that happen to you I think it's gonna be awesome to just share

183
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.400
all of that stuff and because I am a noob if you have been a noob as well and that was your first

184
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.440
time again if there was anything that you didn't expect then you would suggest to other people to

185
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.240
avoid if they are going next year for the first time please share all of that information in the

186
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.760
comments and we'll be super happy to see that and share it with other people as well so thank you so

187
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.680
much for being with us for another episode and we'll see you on the next one.

188
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.360
Bye!
