00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of AWS Bites podcast.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.760
My name is Luciano, and as always, I'm joined by Eoin.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.200
But today is a bit special because we have with us a very special guest, Farrah Campbell.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.760
And I'm sure that if you have done anything with AWS, you are familiar with Farrah.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.560
But in case you're not, Farrah works for AWS, and she is Head of Modern Compute Community.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.360
She's also a prolific international speaker, and she has been working very closely with AWS Heroes.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.160
So today we want to get Farrah's opinion on a bunch of AWS related topics,

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.280
and we're sure it's going to be an awesome and interesting episode.

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.680
So without further ado, let's get into it.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.160
AWS Bites is brought to you by fourTheorem.

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.480
Okay, let's get started.

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.040
So thanks, first of all, Farrah, for taking the time.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.280
We know that you are always super busy and going around off to different conferences and events.

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.760
So it's amazing that you found some time for us,

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.520
and we're really happy to have you here on the podcast.

20
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.760
Should we start maybe with a quick introduction on your side?

21
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.800
Yeah, thank you for having me.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
Sorry it took so long to make this happen.

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.200
I'm super excited to be here.

24
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.840
But yeah, no, my name is Farrah Campbell.

25
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.840
I work at AWS, and I get to work with our amazing developers around the world,

26
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
specifically the Heroes and our Community Builders.

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.240
But yeah, I'm super excited to be here.

28
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.000
Farrah, you mentioned the AWS Heroes program, and that's one thing I really wanted to ask about,

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.240
because we have, I think, a former Hero and a current Hero on the call.

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.960
So tell us about this program.

31
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.520
I think a lot of people are really interested in understanding how you get into it, right?

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.600
What are the features of an AWS Hero?

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400
And maybe do you have any recommendations for people who might like to be a Hero one day?

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.760
Yeah, sure.

35
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.360
No, I mean, like the AWS Heroes program really recognizes

36
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.000
people that go out of their way to help others through knowledge sharing.

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.240
They go above and beyond really trying to make sure that they help to unblock people

38
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.360
with things that they've been able to figure out.

39
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.640
This isn't a program that you can apply for.

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.000
It's not something you can get accepted or rejected from.

41
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.560
It really is a program that looks for people that are going out of their way consistently.

42
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.760
And it's basically, it's something that happens because of other things that you are doing.

43
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.920
And I guess my recommendation would be that for any aspiring Heroes,

44
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.960
that really shouldn't be the goal.

45
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.920
The goal really should be to help others and to continue to go above and beyond for them,

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.800
to share knowledge, trying to help others within the communities that you're a part of.

47
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.320
Maybe you maintain open source projects, but really the goal should be to help others

48
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.800
because there really is no set way to become one.

49
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.440
I still don't even know how I got in.

50
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.320
It sounds like the whole idea of trying to become an AWS Hero is against the very principle really that the people who aren't really trying,

51
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.680
you're just helping people by their nature will get selected.

52
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
I should probably clarify as well.

53
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.040
I mentioned we have a former Hero and that's yourself.

54
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.160
And just in case anybody thinks you can get ejected from the Heroes program,

55
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.560
you probably should explain why you're not allowed to be a Hero anymore.

56
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.880
Yeah, you cannot be a Hero and work at AWS.

57
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.320
The point is to recognize people outside of the company that are working to help others.

58
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.520
It's not about the people internally that are working to help others.

59
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.360
But yeah, I actually thought about that when I was deciding if I was going to actually apply for the job.

60
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.520
So I'm like, did I want to lose my Hero status?

61
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.600
Because I just loved being part of that group so much that it was hard to let that go.

62
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.360
You are still a hero for us, don't worry!

63
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.520
I appreciate that.

64
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.400
Once a part of the group, I think you're always part of the group.

65
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.320
And that's one of the beauties about the program.

66
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.280
And actually, I think just the AWS community in general is just such a welcoming community.

67
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.160
And I feel like there's so many people that work to help each other.

68
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.760
And we actually really enjoy working together and spending time together.

69
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.240
Yeah, I mean, it's a shame that you had to hand in the Hero badge.

70
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.600
But as in your current role, I guess you get to be part of that in a very impactful way.

71
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.320
There's also the AWS Community Builders idea.

72
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.520
And since Heroes sounds like it's very much about community, and getting content out there,

73
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.440
helping people to learn in various different ways, it might be a bit confusing for people.

74
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.400
What is the distinguishing thing about Community Builders compared to Heroes?

75
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah, sure.

76
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.680
I mean, because the Heroes program is a bit more exclusive, and there's no real way to put your hand up and say,

77
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680
hey, I want to be involved.

78
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.240
The Community Builders program was created, it was a few years ago, and that one you can actually apply for.

79
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.240
So we have applications that you can put your name in the pool.

80
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.240
I believe it's once a year, we used to do it twice a year, but now it's just once a year.

81
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.120
And so that the waitlist is open, and we'll review those applications and hopefully accept as many people as possible.

82
00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.400
But that really is the defining differences that you can apply to be an AWS Community Builder and put your hand up to be considered for the program,

83
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.680
or the Hero program, somebody internally has to make that call and to basically reach out to you.

84
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.160
Okay, and so what would you say to people who are saying, okay, that's fine, I just have to wait to be called on as a Hero, but what do I need to do to get involved in Community Builders?

85
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.520
Is there somewhere they should go?

86
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.400
Yeah, I mean, you go to the AWS Developer Center page, and it's listed right there.

87
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.640
Even if you search AWS Community Builders, the application will come right up.

88
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.160
It's a pretty highly utilized site.

89
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.400
But that's really different.

90
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.840
And get involved in the user groups in your area.

91
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.560
Or maybe if you're involved in DevOps, and you want to get involved in the DevOps community,

92
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.000
and then starting to use AWS, but I would really say, just joining some of the local communities that are in your area,

93
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.680
there's so many of them all over the world, it's actually incredible, really.

94
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.320
So there's many opportunities just to kind of start getting involved.

95
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.760
And we also have a lot of people listed on the websites.

96
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.920
And so you can reach out to others that are actually in the community,

97
00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.080
when you join an AWS user group or attend an event, and kind of ask somebody, what did they do to join the program.

98
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.480
But I think really starting to kind of network with the like-minded individuals is really helpful for people that are looking to be part of the program.

99
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.600
That's definitely a great suggestion.

100
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.640
I actually want to change subject just a little bit.

101
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.560
I was in Copenhagen, I think it was AWS Community Day, some time ago, we met there, and I attended your talk.

102
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:29.960
I think it was an amazing talk where you basically share your career and some advices for people that are not necessarily just in cloud, but like more in technology.

103
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:38.360
So maybe one thing that we can talk about today is just a quick summary of your career, what you think were the right choices, the mistakes and the things you learn.

104
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.400
And then in a way, what can we share with people so that we can give them suggestions if they want to get started in tech?

105
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.840
Yeah, no. So actually, mine is really interesting.

106
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.600
You know, I spent over a decade in healthcare management, did not enjoy that really at all.

107
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.360
It just was not, it wasn't fulfilling in any way that I wanted it to be.

108
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.560
And I was always infatuated with the tech industry.

109
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.000
My stepdad had a company that I got to work at when I was 18.

110
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.240
And it was just so fun to be around people that were like creating something from nothing, you know, come up with these random ideas.

111
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.360
And then, you know, they were writing it in that language that I didn't even understand.

112
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.440
So I was just so curious about everything that they were doing.

113
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.760
And it just seemed kind of like magic to me.

114
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:26.680
And then I moved to Portland, Oregon, and there was, I mean, there seemed like there's a kind of a vibrant tech community there coming from like Klamath Falls and Eugene, but there really wasn't at the time.

115
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.960
And so I decided that I wanted to start trying to get involved in tech or get a job and I applied for like a year, nothing happened.

116
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.560
And then I started volunteering at tech events.

117
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.400
The first one was TechFest Northwest.

118
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.480
I ended up meeting Kara Swisher.

119
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.360
And she was basically like, why are you not working in tech?

120
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.440
You seem like you love it.

121
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.040
And I, you know, basically explained I hadn't, nobody was taking my applications, I wasn't getting accepted.

122
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.080
But I had this offer for this part time job.

123
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.880
And she's like, you know, you should really just kind of go for it.

124
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.680
And she sent me Steve Jobs commencement address from Stanford.

125
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.640
And so I did, I, you know, quit my full time job, which was really scary, because I was a single, you know, I was a single mom, I've always been a single mom with two boys.

126
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.040
And so, you know, making sure that I could pay the bills was really important.

127
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.080
But I ended up turning that job into, you know, full time within a month, I was an office manager.

128
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.160
And from there, my, you know, I met somebody at that office.

129
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:26.520
And so then my next role was a director of operations at another small startup, and then another director of operations role that got expanded to customer and people operations.

130
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.440
And then I ended up at Stackery, you know, where it was like, basically my first time, you know, I guess, like out in the field or in the wild.

131
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:43.640
And, you know, really, my goal working there was to build out the AWS relationship and, you know, to help to get, you know, developers interested in the work, you know, the work that we were doing.

132
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.960
And that's kind of really where it all started, you know, it was kind of my first intro working in the cloud at Stackery and into serverless.

133
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.200
And it was just so many exciting things happen.

134
00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:01.440
And so I really think that job was really pivotal, because it allowed me to, you know, put my, you know, to get started with the AWS community and then serverless and things kind of really just took off from there.

135
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.080
It's really crazy, because every single one of my jobs, I was not qualified for at all.

136
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.840
But I somehow made it work.

137
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.840
Is that like an implicit suggestion to people to try to go off their comfort zone and try new things?

138
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.560
That's actually what was my talk was about yesterday is like, you know, stepping outside of your comfort zone.

139
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:37.800
You know, I talked about, you know, as children, we believe we can do anything, you know, like the world is our oyster, you know, I mean, like, jump, I thought I could run as fast as my parents car was going and I obviously couldn't, you know, but, you know, talking about like, instead of thinking that you can't, you know, start telling ourselves that, you know, we can, and really kind of adopt this like growth mindset, you know,

140
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.560
stop questioning our ability, you know, embrace, you know, that that actually failing is an opportunity to grow, and you're only really failing if you give up.

141
00:09:44.560 --> 00:10:00.200
And so I think, yeah, I think really stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying things that, you know, really kind of push you outside of, you know, what you're comfortable doing is kind of key really here, I think, and growing specifically, I think, in this industry, too, because things are just changing all the time.

142
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:08.000
And so I feel like most people are always feeling like they don't know everything and are feeling like they're out of their comfort zone all sometimes, no matter what they're doing.

143
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:17.440
Is that characteristic that kind of perseverance to keep pushing yourself outside your comfort zone until you got that turning point and you were able to get into that role at Stackery?

144
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.520
Is that something that's part of your personality?

145
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.600
Or was that something that you learned through the process?

146
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.160
Was there like a sliding door moment where you could have just called it quits and didn't?

147
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.800
I definitely could have called it quits.

148
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:36.120
I mean, I was in tears basically and having panic attacks on most every single one of the roles that I was doing just because I felt so out of my element.

149
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.760
And I just felt like everybody knew so much more than I did.

150
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:46.560
In fact, I mean, like I as an office manager, I mean, I stopped the meeting because I thought they were talking about people when they were talking about Jason and Cassandra.

151
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:57.760
You know, and so like I was constantly, you know, asking, you know, what I felt were silly questions, but they really weren't, you know, I mean, I remember my first time actually was talking about my first time using the computer.

152
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.360
And it's like when I was 18, I was really kind of doing something.

153
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.160
And then like the error popped up and it said you performed on a legal operation, you know, is going to close down.

154
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.280
And I was so worried the cops were going to get called and I was going to be in trouble with my stepdad.

155
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.960
I mean, it just kind of, you know, I feel like I've constantly, you know, felt out of my element.

156
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.880
But again, I kind of gone back that like that was not me as a child.

157
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.720
I was definitely a go getter.

158
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.800
And I don't know what happened to me over the years that where I came into this questioning everything I can do or sizing myself up.

159
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:36.520
And so I really when I made the decision to make the move to tech, I really decided I was going to be brave, you know, to push myself.

160
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:47.640
I was going to do whatever I could to be positive because there was no way I was going to keep showing up every day when I was feeling like a failure or without, you know, continuing to kind of focus on like the potential that was there.

161
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.080
And just, you know, trying to have some like resilience to, you know, what I was going to be going through.

162
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.080
I think that's really a huge part of, you know, actually kind of growing your career.

163
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.920
And then I don't think anybody exceed, you know, cheap success in isolation.

164
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.680
And so I think, you know, another really critical aspect of my career growth has really been the connections that I've made along the way.

165
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:17.160
Very early on, you know, I was very focused on the relationships, not the transactions that, you know, were at hand and, you know, work to make sure that, yeah, just work to make sure that I was developing

166
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.640
a relationship that would end up helping me.

167
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.680
I mean, some of those early relationships are still helping me, you know, today.

168
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.800
The people that I can lean on, the people that, you know, want to see me succeed.

169
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.800
And I think that's really, really important when you're getting started in tech is, you know, to kind of have somebody there to help support, kind of keep you, help keep you moving forward.

170
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:43.240
You know, somebody else that is, you know, can maybe offer some advice when things seem tough or just to give you some like encouragement when you're ready to throw your keyboard or your computer at the wall because something still isn't working.

171
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:55.200
Another similar question I have is that you moved from kind of a very serverless focused community to a broader role where you are advocating for pretty much the broader world of AWS.

172
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.360
Is there any anything interesting there that you want to share?

173
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.720
Maybe any anecdote, any story or I don't know,

174
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.360
you liked it more when it was serverless and more focused or like the whole AWS gives you more opportunities?

175
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.040
I mean, serverless will always be, have like a very special place in like my heart, just because it was such a different feeling getting started with this community.

176
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.360
You know, everything was so new.

177
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:27.720
Everybody was learning from one another, you know, there was really no wrong answer because you know, people were working to, you know, figure out what they had to solve problems for their own business objectives and those were different, but there was so many different ways to do things,

178
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:27.920
right.

179
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.400
And again, it was just so exciting.

180
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.960
You know, the community really wanted to learn from one another, so it definitely will always hold a special place in my heart.

181
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:43.080
I think the big difference is just understanding like the scale and the amount of things that are happening all over the world and, you know, being able to kind of see that from the inside.

182
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.280
It's just incredible.

183
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.360
And I think another thing is like being able to kind of help bring some of the containers and serverless together.

184
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:57.040
Like I will never forget the very first time I had a call with the Heroes and we had, you know, I was bringing the serverless Heroes and the container Heroes together.

185
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.280
And they're like, I think it was Mike Fielder.

186
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.240
He's like, are we supposed to be on the same call together?

187
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.960
Like, are we allowed?

188
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.120
Like, are we all really going to...

189
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.520
We're bringing this all together.

190
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:13.960
And I think that's really important because it allows the conversations and, you know, for people to learn from things that are working for other teams, you know, that might, you know, different technologies that other people are using.

191
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:27.840
But yeah, I think the scale really, and, you know, coming from small startups, you know, kind of very focused on, you know, very specific, you know, workloads and things that we were at Stackery and now at AWS, it's, you know, it's really incredible.

192
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.240
And it also feels like more pressure.

193
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.840
I'll say that too, because like the impact, anything that you do, there's more impact.

194
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.440
You can have.

195
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.200
And so there's, I think it's, for me, it feels like a lot more pressure to, you know, to do the right thing.

196
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.720
I can only imagine, to be honest, because of the scale of everything you're dealing with at AWS.

197
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.240
But one thing you still do quite a lot of, and you mentioned that, you know, you're just, you're still speaking quite a lot.

198
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.280
You've done a lot of talks around the world, even several keynotes.

199
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:59.760
Is this part of what you were saying about just building your network or what is speaking specifically for you?

200
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.680
What's the goal there?

201
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.160
Why do you do it?

202
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.600
I don't really know why I do it.

203
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.320
I actually am surprised people ask me.

204
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:12.280
I mean, even the first time when I was asked, I didn't know, I actually was really scared to go talk in front of a bunch of developers.

205
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.360
Because I didn't know, I didn't think that they were, I would have anything relevant to say.

206
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.120
But I think it kind of started after I was involved in this documentary called The Chasing Grace.

207
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:29.640
And the film was really about, you know, different aspects of, you know, working in tech specifically, you know, from an, I guess,

208
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.360
from a female's point of view, I'll say that.

209
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.040
But the film I was in is about, you know, closing the pay gap and different ways, you know, women have approached, you know, handling that.

210
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.520
But from there, I had a little bit of exposure.

211
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.000
And I got to meet a few other people.

212
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.480
And I was talking to Andrew Clay Schafer at Reinvent.

213
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.080
This is, I don't know, seven years ago.

214
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.120
And he actually said, I should get up on stage.

215
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.880
He's like, I should start doing talks to kind of help, you know, show people that you can, you know, you can change your career and end up in a good place, right?

216
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:03.840
And so I put my hat into the ring one time at a local event in Portland, Oregon called TAO.

217
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.800
And it was a lightning talk about opening your doors and changing your narrative.

218
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:23.520
And again, it's, you know, kind of shifting your mindset into, you know, I can and, you know, focusing on being positive, you know, choosing to reframe things that are happening on a day to day basis that are negative, that might impact, you know, how I'm feeling to something more positive, you know, so it doesn't affect me and bring me down.

219
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.520
But then after that, I was offered like to DevOps days, Dallas reached out and offered me offered me a slot.

220
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.240
And then from there, serverless days, Sydney, that was my very first international talk, and I will never forget it.

221
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.200
But I think I, you know, I keep doing it because I keep getting asked and I feel like there must be something there.

222
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.080
And people must be learning something from me.

223
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:50.920
So if I if I can help anybody else to, you know, show that that you're making a jump in your career or that, you know, I don't I didn't get a college degree.

224
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.720
You know, I was a very, you know, I was married, divorced with two kids at 24.

225
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.440
And that is not that is not how I envisioned my life to be when I was a teenager.

226
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:08.360
And so I think it's, you know, I'll keep doing this as long as I feel like other or as long as others feel like I have something useful to say.

227
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.080
I've seen you speak in the past, and I think it's clear why you became a Community Hero.

228
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:26.680
Like for anybody, we all suffer from imposter syndrome, but for anybody who has like a harder route into tech, then to be honest, this relatively straightforward route that I had, you know, it could be so challenging for people.

229
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.360
But even even people like I definitely got something out of it from the point of view of thinking about imposter syndrome, which is, I think, universal.

230
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.000
Yeah. And I'm sorry. How do we get over that?

231
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.040
Like, what is I mean, like I even I work with some of the smartest people from all over the world, even I mean, like community members internally at AWS.

232
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.200
And I feel like everybody has imposter syndrome.

233
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.440
I'm like, why is this when like, everybody is so incredible?

234
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:54.080
It just I mean, it makes me feel better sometimes, like selfishly, which I feel bad even saying that when I hear others do.

235
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.160
But I even talk to some distinguished engineers here at AWS that, you know, suffer from it.

236
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.120
I'm like, how is that even possible?

237
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.880
Like, you have so many people that look up to you, you know, how do you why aren't you feeling that, you know, and kind of like, I got this, like, I'm good at what I do.

238
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.080
But maybe maybe someday we'll get there.

239
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.560
But I just feel like I hear so many people talking about imposter syndrome, and I really wish that we could move past that.

240
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560
But it's tough.

241
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.000
Yeah, let's let's see what we can do.

242
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.520
I mean, I think it's great that we're talking about it, because at least then, you know, it helps to build empathy when you realize that everybody's feeling the same way to some degree.

243
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.840
And, you know, to treat people a bit better and avoid a lot of the problems we've had, I guess, traditionally.

244
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.320
So I think any more people we can get out there speaking who aren't speaking today, that that certainly helps.

245
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:52.680
Just just to broaden the voices we have out there, and I'd love to know, do you have any advice for people who are struggling to get out there also nervous, like 99% of people are reluctant to apply and commit to doing public speaking?

246
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.640
Do you have any advice?

247
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.560
Yeah, I mean, I would say start small.

248
00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:07.200
Like, I mean, I got to I and I definitely did that, you know, you want to start with something a little bit more low pressure engagement, you know, maybe like a local meetup, you know, there's web, you know, webinars, you know, there's there's so many different opportunities to kind of throw your hat

249
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:24.000
into the ring. And then I think too, like, it's really important to know your why, you know, so like, why do you want what do you want to speak about? Is it you know, to inspire? Is it to educate to share your experiences, you know, so I think really, that will really help to kind of guide content to make sure that you know, that the information is valuable.

250
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:36.560
And I think, you know, people really connect with stories, you know, personal ones. And I that, you know, that's really how I mean, all my talks have been, you know, focused on that. And they'll start with, like, you know, my story, the journey, the challenges, the triumphs.

251
00:19:36.560 --> 00:20:06.360
I don't think a lot of people even like to talk about the challenges are where like the things that really were hard, or, you know, kind of discussing all the trials and just the inadequacies that you know, you know, you might have had along the way, but I think, you know, really being authentic is really key, you know, to making lasting impact. And, you know, if this is something that you want to do, I think, you know, making sure that it's like, whatever you're doing is authentic is really, really important if you want to continue to do it. And then believing in yourself, like confidence comes from within, you know, remind yourself that, you know, you have valuable insights,

252
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:36.120
that your voice matters, that your opinion matters. And I have reminders that I sent, that are sent to my, that I set up, and I have multiple different ones that help me with, you know, being brave, or just kind of telling myself that I'm like, I'm a badass, like, you got this, you know, and just like, and those are really, really helpful for me to kind of keep going. Because, you know, when I get, sometimes you get into that negative self talk. And so when a reminder kind of pops up, or remind you to step outside, or you got this, it's okay to fail, you know, don't give up, that's actually failing, you know, things like that.

253
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:43.680
I think the reminders have really, really helped me. And I do those a lot when I'm getting ready to do a talk, because it's, I still am so nervous. And just, yeah.

254
00:20:44.240 --> 00:21:02.360
That's definitely a great strategy. I like it. Maybe I'm going to copy it. But yeah, I wanted to remark a little bit the imposter syndrome with a slightly different question. My opinion, at least the way I feel it is more like an anxiety that this world is moving so fast, and you'll never be able to even catch up.

255
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:32.120
Because as you learn something new, there are already five new things that just came out this morning. And you like, really don't even have the time to try to learn all of them. So I think, personally, I feel that this weight of this, this world is going so fast, and I can just try to chase it, but I'll never reach a point where I can say, Oh, yeah, I know everything that there is to know in this craft, because changes so fast, right? Which in a way is great, because our work is so varied, and everything is always new. So every day is a different adventure, but can create that anxiety and that feeling of

256
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:55.280
not good enough for what the world needs right now. So I guess if we try to translate that into the cloud, we have seen lots of changes, of course, since the beginning of the cloud is one of the most rapidly evolving fields in tech. But I think especially in the last few years, there has been a lot of innovation. So maybe my question to you is like, yeah, what do you think about that? And maybe what's your bold prediction for the future of the cloud?

257
00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:25.260
I mean, I think innovation is going to grow and is going to continue at a rapid pace. I don't see it stopping anytime soon. It doesn't feel like it's going to stop. I also agree that things have just seemed like incredibly fast, like changing on I mean, even if you look at like announcements from AWS, there's I mean, there's something coming out, we're getting close to reinvent, there's going to be so many new things that are now said it's really, really hard to keep up with. And I feel like it does, like kind of it makes you feel like inadequate. But I think yeah, like the innovation and growth will continue. I honestly think there's going to be more adoption and trust.

258
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:55.040
You know, with AI, ML, the Gen AI, I think it's going to become part of just the tooling conversation. I don't think it's going to be the focus on Gen AI, I think it's going to be this is kind of going to be like your assistant that people are using. I think that's probably my big thing is that. I think that we've over indexed talking about it so much. But I really, I mean, I see how it can be helpful. I use a lot of these tools to, you know, kind of get some of the grunt work out. And so it allows me to work more on strategic things instead of the actual, you know, the building this random, you know,

259
00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:25.160
going through survey data and trying to, you know, make some assumptions like and I can easily create an app that does things like that for you know, for me. But I think that it's soon it will just become part of like the tooling that people are using. And there won't be such a focus on like, let's make sure we say this as a word in part of the you know, the the blog post just so we can get attention. It kind of reminds me of like when well serverless was that way very early on, like blockchain was that way, you know, early on, I mean, the same is like, it's Yeah, it'll it'll move on.

260
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:42.840
And it just kind of become part of the way we work. And I don't think that I think we're all going to be learning, we're all going to have to learn just as much as we do today. In five years, 10 years, I don't think the pace ever stops. Because it just the more we learn, the more we want to do more of and it just it just keeps just keeps going.

261
00:23:42.840 --> 00:24:12.760
Yeah, absolutely. I agree that there is a little bit too much of a hype on GenAI. My theory is that because it's something that has an effect that is like tangible on everyone, even people that are not necessarily techie, I think that that's maybe kind of inflating the conversation a little bit more than it should. But yeah, I agree with your prediction that it's going to become more of a tool that we will be using naturally in our day to day life, whether it's tech or not, maybe is even irrelevant. But yeah, it's something that we are going to just be be used to it and not even think so much about it.

262
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:42.680
Yeah, or like, just, you know, I think even to now, like people are, you know, kind of, I don't know, you kind of want to step away or like, maybe I don't want to even read that because I'm sick of hearing about it. You know, people won't feel like that anymore. But yeah, it's, it's a it's a crazy time. And I don't see it ever ending. But I mean, was it different earlier on? Like, when do you I'm actually very curious. I have a question for you guys that have been in this a lot longer than I have, you know, how like, how you really think in the last three to four years, it's been a lot different.

263
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.560
Or have you seen this this this kind of pace of innovation start earlier than you know, what I've experienced?

264
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.520
I'll let you go first, Eoin.

265
00:24:46.840 --> 00:25:12.520
Yeah. You know, it does feel like it repeats itself for sure. And I'm sure you've seen that as well for like, that these these hype words come and come into this cycle for two or three years, and it was blockchain and crypto and web three. And there's always something right. Gen AI is definitely different, because it seems every time there's a new one, it gets amplified a little bit. So I think part of that is like the social media growth effect as well.

266
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:42.200
It just, it amplifies every message so much until you can barely tolerate the amount of noise around it. But unfortunately, that means that it's, there's very little space for 'sane discussion', if I could call it that, or just meaningful discussion, because everything is drowned out. So I think you just it feels I don't know what you think, but it feels like you just kind of have to wait until the noise dissipates to find out exactly what's left. That's that's going to be sustainable and meaningful into the future. I'm definitely I definitely have Gen AI fatigue just

267
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:50.000
from listening to the term. But I still it's still exciting, right? But it's very hard to actually keep that excitement going when there's so much hype.

268
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.360
I definitely agree with that. I definitely agree with that.

269
00:25:52.760 --> 00:26:12.080
Yeah, I agree as well. I think that the bit that maybe we are not talking nearly as much is not Gen AI in itself. I think as a topic, it can be interesting. There's definitely lots of interesting stuff in there.

270
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:39.440
But I think we are failing to bring to the conversation table, the pros and cons, like the why and the when and the how and it's not a solution for everything. So I think if we get to a conversation where we focus more on the technicalities of it, where we say, okay, for this use case, maybe yes, maybe this way, for this other use case, it might look like it makes sense. But then in reality, there are other solutions that might be better. So it's not like it's a universal tool that is going to solve all the problems. And I think that's what the media's are actually portraying. And that's a little bit misleading and annoying from somebody that comes with a little bit of a technical background.

271
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.240
So hopefully when we get there, I think the conversations are going to get a little bit more useful and maybe less annoying.

272
00:26:45.760 --> 00:27:02.600
I definitely agree. I feel like we've over indexed on it so hard and make it like promise it's going to do all these things. But I really see it as an assistance. It can be like somebody could do some helpful things, but you're still going to check on it. You're not going to just use whatever somebody gave you.

273
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:22.520
But anyhow, I also remember you brought up the buzzwords. So when I was at Stackery, I made a shirt called, it just said, 'Continuously DevOpsing microserverless', because I just was like, I'm going to put all the buzzwords on the shirt. It was so funny. I made socks and shirts actually. And they were actually a pretty big hit.

274
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.080
You need to do an updated version with Gen AI now.

275
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.960
Gen AI, NFT, Web3. Yeah, no, I'm just kidding.

276
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.800
That can be an outfit for re:Invent.

277
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:44.480
Well, actually, Matt Bonig told me he wanted to wear an outfit. He wants to be a mascot at re-invent. And so maybe I'll tell him he has to pick something that works with that.

278
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.320
We'll take some of the credits when that happens.

279
00:27:47.320 --> 00:28:02.320
Okay, let's change the subject a little bit. We actually have just one last question, which is a little bit of a fun one. If you have a favorite cover art of AWS Bites podcast, just because we spend more time, I think, creating the cover art than everything else. I think this is an important question for us.

280
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.320
So I think my mind has to be good amped with Jeremy Daly because I like the reference to Sound of Music.

281
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.320
Nice. Yeah, that's a good choice.

282
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.320
Are they all, it looks like they are all based on some movies and things.

283
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:25.320
I don't know. I think they're pretty random. Whatever is the inspiration of the day, but definitely there have been a few inspired by movies. So yeah.

284
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:33.320
So do you have any final remark or anything else that you want to share? If people maybe want to connect with you or shout to you, where can they find you?

285
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:49.320
They can find me on Twitter. I still call it Twitter. I'm not gonna not call it Twitter. But I'm with FarrahC32 on Twitter. I'm probably more active there than LinkedIn. But I also, you know, I try to, I try to be as active as I can on as many of these social sites as you know, that I have time for.

286
00:28:50.320 --> 00:29:00.320
But yeah, LinkedIn, Twitter. I love connecting with others. So you know, please do reach out. Definitely always happy to help. And if people have questions about how to kind of get started in, you know, within the community, they want to ping me directly.

287
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.320
I'm, you know, that please do. I try to, you know, work with as many people and offer help and support wherever I can.

288
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:16.320
And to make that a little bit easier, we'll make sure to have all these links in the show notes. So you don't have to remember or try to do the spelling. Just just click on the link and you can connect with Farrah.

289
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:25.320
So again, thank you so much for being with us. It's been an honor and a pleasure. So yeah, again, amazing stuff. And thank you, everybody, for listening in today.

290
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:35.320
And hopefully this was interesting to you. Leave us a comment. Let us know if there was any question that we might have missed, because maybe we'll do another episode in the future with Farrah and we can ask more questions.

291
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.320
So, all right. Thank you so much, everyone. And we'll see you in the next one.
