00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello and welcome to another special episode of AWS Bites.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.560
I'm Eoin and today Luciano is taking a break from AWS Bites duties.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.760
That's because we're joined by a special guest, Fiona McKenna,

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.120
co-founder, CFO and head of HR at fourTheorem.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.640
Fiona has been working in tech for most of her career,

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.200
helping startups and larger organizations grow and be successful.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.500
I've been lucky enough to work with Fiona at fourTheorem for more than five years now.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.180
And in that time, I've benefited from Fiona's expertise in running startups,

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.060
making and raising money, as well as building successful teams of great people.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.000
We're going to talk about startup advice, hiring amazing people,

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.520
creating an environment for success and, of course, managing cloud cost.

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:56.360
AWS Bites is brought to you by fourTheorem.

13
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.820
If you're looking for a partner to architect, develop and modernize on AWS,

14
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.280
give fourTheorem a call.

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.660
Check out fourTheorem.com and the link will be in the show notes.

16
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.420
So first of all, welcome to AWS Bites, Fiona.

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320
I know you're a long-term fan and listener.

18
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.240
Can you start by telling us a little bit about yourself?

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.440
I am a long-term fan and I'm absolutely thrilled to be here today, Eoin.

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.940
Thank you so much for inviting me.

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.360
And I'm really looking forward to seeing what artwork you guys come up with for this week's podcast.

22
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.540
So yeah, about me.

23
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm a startup-aholic.

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.360
I've had a career of two parts.

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.060
I'm almost 40 years working.

26
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.120
I'm going to discount the first 15 because that was in banking and insurance

27
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.860
and foreign direct investment manufacturing type businesses.

28
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.120
And I forayed into the world of cloud before there was an internet, really a proper cloud for them.

29
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.920
So in 1999, when I was part of a business that was called Virtual Financial Management,

30
00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.660
it was using a frame relay solution to create the illusion of global access to financial ERPs on the cloud.

31
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.640
And it didn't last.

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.560
It lasted about four months before we didn't get our funding.

33
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.320
But it brought me, it opened the door for me to join telecoms.

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.040
And from telecoms, I've gone into really businesses that have been in all sorts of different industries,

35
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.780
but always centred around using technology or harnessing the next evolution of technology

36
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.640
to drive their business growth and to stay relevant.

37
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.760
Maybe we can start with talking about the people side of the business, because I think that's something that really interests people and hiring and growing teams.

38
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.820
It seems like something of an unsolved problem.

39
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.880
We had an episode (87) where we talked about interviewing at fourTheorem.

40
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.080
A lot of people really seemed to like that one because it gave a bit of an insight into the inner workings.

41
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.620
Maybe from your perspective, what do you look for as we're growing the team?

42
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.200
So it's always about the people.

43
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.500
I mean, it's really amazing.

44
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.640
And this has been true for my whole career.

45
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.580
You might get excited about the technology aspect of it,

46
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.440
but the technology is really just the tool that enables people to demonstrate, showcase their skill sets.

47
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.100
And we're looking for people.

48
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.140
I'm looking for curious, interested people that sort of want to push the boundaries a bit,

49
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.060
take themselves out of their comfort zone,

50
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.900
maybe don't know exactly what they want to do next,

51
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.820
but know that they want to do something different.

52
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.040
And I've listened maybe to our podcasts or seen us at conferences and events and things

53
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.760
and know that we could give them an opportunity to grow and to take their career to the next level.

54
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.360
Maybe it's worthwhile taking the opportunity then to shout out to everyone who's listening.

55
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.440
If you do feel like you've got something that is a fit for us to get in touch,

56
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.100
because we're always happy to look at new people, right?

57
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.540
Absolutely, always.

58
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.500
And I'll have a chat with anybody that's interested, that has something to offer us, or something that we can offer them.

59
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.840
I'd love to have a chat.

60
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.660
And that's part of our process.

61
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.560
We call them chats for a reason.

62
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.160
We try to keep the process as informal as possible.

63
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.960
We're not the traditional organization that has 18 different types of interviews,

64
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.200
and they're trying to catch you out.

65
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.980
We're truly looking to see, is there a good fit between you as an individual and us as a company,

66
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.320
and how we can grow together, and what you can bring to our culture,

67
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.240
and how you can help us to develop and grow, and vice versa.

68
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.840
So that's always better done if you're actually just chatting to somebody.

69
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.220
You can really get to know them, as opposed to asking them where they see themselves in five years' time,

70
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.660
or drilling down and trying to catch them out on something on their CV.

71
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.080
That's really not what we're interested in at all.

72
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.880
Yeah, and we always try to get people, I guess, to understand that it's a two-way process.

73
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.980
You know, they can interview us as well.

74
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.520
It's difficult, of course, for people to really accept that,

75
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.320
and understand that they're not being evaluated and critically analyzed.

76
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.420
But it's definitely something we value, isn't it?

77
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.520
The opportunity for people to really see if we're a fit for them as well.

78
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.160
Yeah, I mean, I really can't stress that enough.

79
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.380
You know, it really is.

80
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.820
And we've spoken to some great people, right?

81
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.860
Where it's been clear that there might be some gap in their CV to date,

82
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.720
that they need to bridge that first.

83
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.760
So, you know, that's the other reason for keeping the chat stay informal.

84
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.940
Talk to us now.

85
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.460
We can give you a steer as to what gaps you should be filling,

86
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.420
what other experiences should we be looking for.

87
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.580
And come and talk to us in a year's time, two years' time, three years' time.

88
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320
If there's one thing we know is how fast time flies,

89
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.460
and that we meet the same people.

90
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.800
You know, the tech ecosystem is such a small world

91
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.600
that you're going to meet each other at different points in time

92
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.180
in our career.

93
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.680
And if it isn't a good fit today, it might be a good fit in the future.

94
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.720
But everybody, I like to think that everybody gets something

95
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.040
from going through the interview process with us.

96
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.700
And we really do.

97
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.940
We set that side of time.

98
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.000
At the end of it, you know, we always make sure

99
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.920
it isn't all questions going our way.

100
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.200
There's always time at the end of each interview

101
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.620
for them to come back and ask us those type of questions.

102
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.280
We often hear from other people saying, oh, hiring is the biggest challenge we have.

103
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.640
Would you agree?

104
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.440
Do you think, what are your biggest challenges

105
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.700
when recruiting the right people?

106
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.660
How do you feel we go about attracting and retaining

107
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.560
as well the right people in what is, I suppose, a competitive field?

108
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.560
It is.

109
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.340
It is a very competitive space out there.

110
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.460
Look, we're very, very lucky because of our profile

111
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.680
as individuals as much as as a company.

112
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.820
We get a huge amount of inbound people coming in to talk to us

113
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.160
who feel they have a really good sense of what fourTheorem is about.

114
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.340
I give credit to you, Luciano, I think the podcast,

115
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.600
the consistency of that over over 100 episodes.

116
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.920
You really get to see what what life is like

117
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.180
within the fourth era of ecosystem over a continued pace of time.

118
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.720
But we're not acting in how we do things.

119
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.540
We're really honest about the good and the bad.

120
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.360
We're very transparent.

121
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.640
Transparency and openness, it's it's part of our DNA

122
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.500
and it's there from the very first interviews the whole way through.

123
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.000
So we have we've a great inbound pipeline, if you like, of potential people.

124
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.340
And then I think it's important for us to explain that, you know what, we're not, you know,

125
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.360
so we're not that big global multinational

126
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.640
and we don't necessarily have the same packages that they can offer.

127
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.460
But I always ask people to focus on effective hourly rate, for example,

128
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.880
in terms of how you work for us.

129
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.000
We don't ask people to do 90 hours a week.

130
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.280
In fact, we actively work to ensure that they do not do 90 hours a week.

131
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.060
You know, we don't schedule any calls with people after 530 in the evening.

132
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.100
We try to highly hire people that are kind of living within plus or minus two hours of our time zone

133
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.320
because we just don't want to be that business.

134
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.000
You know, as people starting at 5 a.m. and still working at 11 p.m. at night,

135
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.720
that's not really what we're about.

136
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.960
I think that's a big part of our retention.

137
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.600
I think I think the next generation that's coming through, Gen Z and their ilk,

138
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.740
they have much more understanding about the importance of a rounded life.

139
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.200
And, you know, I know in my own case, my family told me that they looked at us as parents

140
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200
and they didn't want to repeat the kind of career that they saw when they were, you know,

141
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.320
10 and 12 growing up and the hours that myself and my husband were doing.

142
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.820
They don't want to work like that.

143
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.080
They want to they want to do a good day's work and then they want to have a life outside of work.

144
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.800
And I think a company like fourTheorem has a great way of balancing those needs

145
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.480
and making sure that they get all of their growth potential within a career perspective,

146
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.560
but they also get to live their life as well.

147
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.580
So I think that's really kind of played to our advantage.

148
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.140
Retention also is part of, you know, acknowledging that they won't be with us forever.

149
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.580
So we're not trying to lock people in to stay with us for the next 10 or 15 years.

150
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.020
Maybe this is where they spend five years, seven.

151
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.820
Maybe they do spend 10 years with us,

152
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.060
but only if they're continuing to get the growth opportunities and it's working for them.

153
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.400
We're not we're not looking to sort of lock people in.

154
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.420
We want people to be with us if it's the right thing for them,

155
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.140
because ultimately that means we end up giving the right result to our clients.

156
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.680
We've got happy, motivated people who are enjoying their work.

157
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.880
They're doing interesting things.

158
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.300
They're solving gnarly problems.

159
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.680
And if they get to the point where they're not feeling that they're able to do that,

160
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.400
they can move on to something different and we wish them well.

161
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.040
Hopefully they'll bring us into their other businesses and help us solve problems there with them.

162
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.160
So you've been part of companies that have grown larger than fourTheorem is today.

163
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.540
What are the challenges that you think people should watch out for as they go from a small team?

164
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.780
If you're growing to 50, 100 people and beyond, what have you seen?

165
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.700
What do you recommend there?

166
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.800
Oh, you have to accept that there's growing pains.

167
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.440
You know, that's the biggest the biggest challenge of it is.

168
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.960
And as your team grows to, you know, from the from the 20 to the 50 people, your focus.

169
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.780
I'm talking now in the context of leaders and founders.

170
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.740
Your focus is going to have to narrow.

171
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.220
You know, you can't be everything to everybody or you'll become the blocker.

172
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.940
You will be the one that's getting in the way of growth and progress.

173
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.840
So I think from from the very early days, you need to be thinking about where do you make the most impact in the organization?

174
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.520
Which we know. So where do you stay?

175
00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.960
Where do you when your focus has to narrow or where is your your focus going to narrow into so that you're delivering the most for the rest of the team?

176
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.240
And then you need to be making sure that you're bringing in people behind you.

177
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.600
And you're always thinking about that succession plan.

178
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.460
You know, your business is going to be different.

179
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.820
The culture is going to be different.

180
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.680
And you have to accept to that.

181
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:23.640
And this is the hard part of it is that sometimes you're going to have to bring in people that are very different to you because the leadership team of a business of well over 100 people will have different qualities.

182
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.920
And afterwards to the crazy mad entrepreneur chaos monkeys that are able to adapt fast and make decisions fast.

183
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.360
They'll become more process driven, more more, you know, numbers oriented.

184
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:40.920
And that might suit you. So, you know, you have to think about your own step down date, your own best before date.

185
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.140
You know, when do I when do I stop becoming a force for good in the organization?

186
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.360
And when do I start becoming part of the problem or something that's blocking it?

187
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.660
And you need to let go of control.

188
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.580
Fantastic advice.

189
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.800
I could dish it out all day.

190
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.960
I'm not 100 percent sure how well I can live to it because of my own personal experience.

191
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.600
I've voted my way out whenever the company has gotten to that sort of size and I can't have my finger in Santa Pots.

192
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.280
I've moved on to the next job.

193
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.600
So I'm going to have to learn, live my own advice in our growth journey here and forth here as a founder.

194
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.180
I'll have to make sure that I don't overstay my best before date.

195
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.080
I think we all struggle with that, right?

196
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.920
You want to feel responsible, I suppose, for the success of the company.

197
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.660
Therefore, it seems like a contradiction to accept that the continued success will mean taking a step back.

198
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.320
And that it's OK to make yourself dispensable.

199
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.080
It's so easy to say.

200
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.520
But then actually doing it is that living it is is the really hard.

201
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.560
It's the really hard thing.

202
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.400
Now, I have made myself redundant in the past.

203
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.060
So I have some experience of of having done it.

204
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.480
And I did have I can remember a point of time.

205
00:11:51.580 --> 00:12:00.020
I'm speaking with a CEO and basically saying, you know, that the role that I was doing, I was not I was not the most effective person in doing that role.

206
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.800
And we needed to sort of split things out.

207
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.880
And it was but it's very hard.

208
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:12.060
It's a very hard thing to do, because mostly, certainly if you set up a business or if you're if you're off that sort of entrepreneurial mindset, you like to be stuck into everything.

209
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.580
And and you're successful in part because you believe you're actually really good at everything.

210
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.780
And that, you know, that confidence, that belief sometimes drives results, too.

211
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:36.380
So it's I think having having good advisors in the background that are that you kind of you're checking in with, not not within the company necessarily, but maybe your own mentors, that they're good people sort of to help hold you to account, you know, to check in with regularly and go, well, this is where we're at now.

212
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.140
And I'm thinking about this and that and then take take their advice.

213
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.600
If you ask people's advice, listen to it.

214
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:53.400
Yeah, I think that piece of advice about knowing your limits and knowing when to step back, it's not just true for startup founders, but probably everybody in any position.

215
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.840
So I think a lot of people are going to get benefit from that.

216
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.760
But you're known very well for advising startups about hiring, running the company, financing and funding.

217
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.740
A lot of our listeners will be involved in startups or might even be thinking of taking that leap.

218
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:15.400
So what advice would you offer them apart from the stuff we've already mentioned about, you know, growth, etc?

219
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.100
Well, do it.

220
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.200
First of all, if you have this voice in your head that's telling you you need to do it, you should do it.

221
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.000
I don't look back in 40 years time.

222
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.600
And so there was that window when I really had this great idea and I didn't do it for all the reasons.

223
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.840
You can make the list of reasons on both sides.

224
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.200
But if it's really if it's inside you, you should follow your dream.

225
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.260
You should really do it.

226
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.020
Then you have to get sensible.

227
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.040
OK, so that's the that's the emotional part.

228
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.760
You've made the decision.

229
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.540
You're going to do it.

230
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.400
It's always about cash, right?

231
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.200
It always starts about cash.

232
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.440
It's about cash.

233
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.560
If you're raising money, you need to make sure you get the right money.

234
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.860
So if you're taking it in from investors, it can be so tempting when you get these term sheets put in front of you.

235
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.160
Somebody believes in your dream to go.

236
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.820
I'm just going to sign this the first offer and I'm going to take it.

237
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:12.200
Make sure that that you're taking money from the right partner, that somebody that is investing truly in your business plan and what you want to do with the business.

238
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:19.600
And isn't just seeing an opportunity for a quick return or won't change the goalposts if things get hard, as they inevitably do.

239
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.420
I've been in so many startups.

240
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.880
Nothing has ever gone to plan.

241
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.720
Something has always come out of the woodwork to change you or shock you and catch you along the way.

242
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.480
So getting the right partner and the right money is sort of the first part of it.

243
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.080
And then minding that money.

244
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.980
You know, again, it's you know, there's something around.

245
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.020
I think it's revenues, vanity, profit is sanity and cash is king.

246
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.520
You know, I work it, always work it back from cash.

247
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.680
If you're stressed about cash, if you're stressed about making payroll, you've got people that have left jobs to come and work with you.

248
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.760
And now it's coming to the end of the month and you don't have enough cash in the bank to pay the wages.

249
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.620
You will not be able to run your business effectively.

250
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.120
You will make the wrong decisions.

251
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.020
You you'll become revenue focused to get cash in the bank first thing and first out of the way.

252
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.280
Like it distracts from everything.

253
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.180
So get your nest egg.

254
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.700
Three months is kind of my rule of thumb.

255
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.900
Three months runway, three months of paying the rent in the building and all of the wages.

256
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.660
So that cash flow isn't isn't making you make bad decisions.

257
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.600
So mind your cash.

258
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.760
Never ignore a letter with a harp on it.

259
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.180
So get all your other stuff done right, too.

260
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.480
If you can afford a bookkeeper, an accountant, hire one day one.

261
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.000
If you can't and you're doing it yourself, you know, do it properly.

262
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.000
Pay your VAT, pay your PRSI.

263
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.320
You know, these things I've seen so many people to get tempted.

264
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.280
We'll pay this. We'll pay the VAT man later.

265
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.220
Revenue don't do interest free loans.

266
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.300
They don't care. You know, they say they care, but they don't care.

267
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.100
They want their money.

268
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.220
So, you know, pay pay all your bills.

269
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.360
Keep on top of things.

270
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.500
If you're not going to be able to pay things, get out in front of it as early as you possibly can and take the cash distraction off the table.

271
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.800
And then the other big piece of advice is it's much easier to co-found with others.

272
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.880
You know, it's a lonely journey if you're doing it on your own.

273
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.120
And if you can't find other people to come on that journey with you, that's a much you're minimizing the risk.

274
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:18.960
You're giving yourself confidants, people to talk to, to share the whole, all of the hard decisions to sense check things with.

275
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.640
But when you're doing that, too, get the paperwork out of the way to begin with.

276
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.140
Get your shareholders agreement.

277
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.620
I call it like the prenup, you know, figure out how how will you start company if you hate each other's guts.

278
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.200
Write all that down and then hopefully put it in a folder somewhere and it never has to be looked at again.

279
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.080
But at least you then have no matter how much you love each other right now.

280
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.600
Exactly. Exactly.

281
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:49.240
And it's a hard thing to do because you think like we're all we're all on the same page and I never I'd never mess you over.

282
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.860
I'd never do this. But then life gets in the way and things change.

283
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.920
And maybe the direction of the business changes and one person isn't happy that you're doing this and you're not doing that.

284
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:04.760
And if you don't have that, if you didn't, if you didn't sit down and work all this stuff out in the beginning, it can be really, really damaging.

285
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.060
It can be damaging to you as an individual, the stress it brings on.

286
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.860
It can be damaging to the business, to the brand that you've all worked so hard to build.

287
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.600
So get your prenup, sign it and then, as I said, hopefully put it in the drawer and never have to look at it again.

288
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.440
And I think the last key piece of advice is, and I referred to this earlier, too, is find yourself some mentors.

289
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.800
What I've always been amazed by is how willing people are, particularly Irish people, to give you advice.

290
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.460
It's a big it's a big compliment to be asked to be a mentor to somebody.

291
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:43.440
And most people take that compliment very seriously and they take the ask and they commit to it in a way that is, you know, so generous and so overwhelming.

292
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.720
And then you get to pay it back in future, too.

293
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.700
You know, and that's why I try not to say no if people ask me for help, because when I was asking others for help, they were always there for it.

294
00:17:51.700 --> 00:18:09.040
And if you have those those mentors, again, because they're not in the day in the day to day fray and the decisions that kind of wear you down sometimes, they can help bring you back to your core values, what your mission is, you know, help you sort of do a reset so that you bring your best self into the business.

295
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.600
Great advice.

296
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.020
And maybe we should clarify for our international audience, a letter with a harp on it.

297
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.180
It's not a letter from Guinness, right?

298
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.120
It's from the government!

299
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.340
Yeah, for Americans,

300
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.040
it's the IRS.

301
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:37.720
OK, so staying on the topic of money, then let's cover cloud economics, because look, when you mention cloud and money, the whole business model around cloud can't be far off.

302
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.840
And you've worked in tech before and after the advent of cloud computing as have I, and a lot of people at Fortheirum.

303
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.380
Now, this usually means shifting from upfront investment to pay-per-use pricing.

304
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.100
And we often see it as a big win, especially for startups who might be low on capital in the beginning.

305
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.420
It seems like a fair deal.

306
00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:03.180
Is that benefit recognized widely, do you think, by CFOs, other financial leaders in the broader tech industry and in other industries?

307
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.000
Sadly, no.

308
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.420
I don't think so.

309
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.160
You know, it's really interesting.

310
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.840
We've had this conversation a lot internally, and when we're doing these sales proposals, we think about, you know, this is great.

311
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.520
You know, it's all going to be OPEX now.

312
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:24.780
But in businesses, particularly in bigger businesses, their financial modeling tends to be in two parts.

313
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.640
You've got your OPEX plan for next year, and then you've got your capital plan, that might be multi-year.

314
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.780
And it can often be a lot easier, right, especially in the bigger organizations, to get that capital plan over the line.

315
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.560
Because the very nature of us as accountants is, you know, we like to see assets.

316
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:48.100
We like to put, you've been there, I'm sure, Eoin, you're putting the sticky label on each individual piece of kit.

317
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:55.460
You can bring people in and bring them down, show them your server room with all these lights flashing and multi-million investment.

318
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.460
Everybody can really get their arms around it and feel comfortable.

319
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.960
And you've got that predictability.

320
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.920
I'm writing that cost over five years.

321
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.300
That depreciation figure is never going to change.

322
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.880
I know what my tax-free allowances are going to be like on it.

323
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:17.500
From a point of view of certainty, it's the old world, the on-prem world, was a much more certain environment for the CFOs.

324
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.000
And because we tended to be less involved with really understanding how tech works,

325
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.740
we never really considered too much about that wasted capacity, you know.

326
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:34.100
You spent to the most bursty, busiest day of the year, you know, be it Black Friday or whatever it happened to be,

327
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.860
you had enough compute power for that.

328
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.340
You never really thought about how much that was wasted then for the other 365, four days of the year.

329
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.580
It just didn't really come into the frame of reference.

330
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:55.980
So I think the whole benefits of cloud from a cost point of view are not really fully understood yet by the wider accountancy profession.

331
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.620
And I think there's a long way to go on that.

332
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.100
And that's only to get them to understand lifting and shifting, right?

333
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.100
You know, from my data center to another data center.

334
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.980
An understanding about modern architecture and truly software that, you know,

335
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.420
you're only paying to be used when you need to use it.

336
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.180
You know, those principles aren't fully understood.

337
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.640
And I think as a profession, we're not very good at trying to make ourselves, inform ourselves,

338
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.600
be better educated on how cloud comes.

339
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.940
You know, in previous businesses, there was always that kind of chasm between the engineering people,

340
00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.120
be it, you know, physical kit engineering or software engineers and the accountants on the other side.

341
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:39.200
And I've spent my career trying to kind of bridge that gap in any organization I've worked in.

342
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.260
And there's still a lot more bridges to be built.

343
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.680
Maybe kind of a related question is around migration, right?

344
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.040
Because cost is obviously a big component of that.

345
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.120
But you've seen kind of firsthand what it looks like when we work with clients migrating to AWS.

346
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.600
And this is a big step.

347
00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.080
There's a lot of fear, I think, there.

348
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.420
Do you have any advice from your experience for larger companies thinking about moving to the cloud?

349
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.640
Again, like so many of the rest of our conversations on, the common thread comes through again.

350
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.180
It's start with your people.

351
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.080
You know, you really need to engage as many people in the organization as you possibly can.

352
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.560
Once this migration conversation, modernization, even if we call it, you know, it's become part of it.

353
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:29.460
You know, it's very easy to assume that your IT team, that they have all the skills necessary to make this happen.

354
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.100
They probably don't.

355
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.460
If they've been, you know, armed deep in keeping your monolith alive for the last 20 years,

356
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.500
it's not leaving them a huge amount of time to educate themselves on cloud technologies.

357
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.340
And they are not the same thing.

358
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:56.080
You know, it's not as simple as if I've got a software engineer that that same software engineer can build this big pathway to migrate me off that monolith into this microservices environment.

359
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.420
There's a massive learning curve there, and it can be terrifying.

360
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.760
You know, and you load on top of that the fact that for the last 12 months, every time you opened anything,

361
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.380
all you were reading about was Gen AI coming to take over everybody's jobs.

362
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:20.940
So now you've got people maybe using old tech, wondering, is the management going to, you know, bring in some Gen AI solution that's going to walk them out of their jobs?

363
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.840
So you've got all of those uncertainties going there, too.

364
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:32.060
So I think the more consultation is involved, the more you get the whole team looking at this and then identify this.

365
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.920
This is, you know, you're going to eat this elephant one bite at a time.

366
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.220
Find the easiest bite to take.

367
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:45.880
The first, most, you know, most easily digestible broken down piece that you can migrate so that people can see the value.

368
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.540
You know, do that small project.

369
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.740
Involve as many people looking at the results of this as possibly can.

370
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.760
So you build up their confidence and pick the right partner.

371
00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:01.180
Of course, I'm going to sit here and say pick the right partner, but it really does make sense, whether it's fourTheorem or some other partner.

372
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.980
Find somebody who does this as their bread and butter.

373
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.640
These are not trivial things to do.

374
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.980
They're hard projects.

375
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:17.580
But when you talk to somebody like ourselves that we've been doing this now in this particular environment for seven or eight years, you know, we see a lot of repeat problems.

376
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:23.660
The industries might change, but the gnarly part stays very similar across the individual things.

377
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.160
We can help them identify those quick wins.

378
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:36.480
And then also we can go in there and work with the team and do that valuable upskilling, leaving them at the end, of course, with still with our jobs intact, but much more interesting jobs now.

379
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.460
You know, you remember that project where we deleted 70 percent of their code base.

380
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.860
You know, when you're not maintaining when you're maintaining a code base, it's only 30 percent of its original size.

381
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.660
That leaves you a lot of time to help innovate.

382
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.440
To be more impacting on the business and to have a more interesting job.

383
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.660
So they'll retain their people.

384
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.900
They'll upskill their people and they'll be they'll be ready for the next disruptor that comes along.

385
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.580
The ones that put their head in the sand and go, do you know what?

386
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.820
I bought that big on prem upgrade two years ago.

387
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.740
I'll wait till it dies.

388
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.820
I have another five or six years to run about it.

389
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:16.600
They're going to wake up one day and find that there's another revolution or something has come along that's completely going to eat their lunch and leave them in a panic mode.

390
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.600
And that's not the way to do it.

391
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:35.500
OK, since we're talking about AWS partnering, obviously, fourTheorem is known as a top AWS partner.

392
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.720
There's room for plenty more.

393
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.060
There's a lot of work out there to be done.

394
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:45.140
So a lot of people out there, especially our listeners, right, might be thinking of either freelancing or starting off their own cloud consultancy.

395
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.580
What advice can we impart, specifically you, Fiona?

396
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.380
Do you have any tips, tricks, warnings to share?

397
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.440
Well, all the earlier warnings about, you know, setting up your business and cash flow, right, and investment.

398
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.160
Take that as, you know, the first stuff to do.

399
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.960
But if you're thinking, let's imagine you're already out there, you know, and you think, oh, I'm going to become an AWS partner.

400
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.860
This will be great.

401
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.080
And I give a bit of advice around that.

402
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:19.200
And I think, you know, first and foremostly, and to be fair, AWS tell you this out the gate, you know, they're not going to fill your sales pipeline.

403
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.080
Well, of course, you do think when you become a partner that they will fill your sales pipeline.

404
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:24.940
And they do.

405
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.820
They have because you look, they have loads of these account management teams.

406
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.280
But they are never going to fully get you in the way that you get your own business.

407
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:39.440
So if you become a partner, understand that you have to, you have to, first of all, you've got to be responsible for your own sales process.

408
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:46.560
So becoming a partner from AWS or Azure or anybody else isn't going to solve your new business pipeline piece.

409
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.540
You have to solve that for yourself.

410
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.380
Once you accept that, then you can really lean in and you can leverage these partnerships to the best of their ability.

411
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.880
Bearing in mind that you will almost always be smaller than these huge, big organizations.

412
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.380
So there's going to be a level of bureaucracy.

413
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.800
You'll deal with some wonderful people, but the system and the process will be very frustrating.

414
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:16.160
They'll have rules, you know, AWS funding rules can be like looking at health care plans in Ireland where you're going, I don't know how to compare one with the next.

415
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.080
You can get very caught up with, you know, trying to keep up with it.

416
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.420
And they do a great job of selling their programs.

417
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:30.060
But make sure that if you are going to attach yourself with a program, if you keep coming back to first principles and saying, is this the right thing for me?

418
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:36.540
Because they will require a lot of investment on your part in accreditations and upskilling your teams and getting pieces of paper.

419
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.420
And if that's right for your business, do it for sure.

420
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.500
But make sure you've validated that up first.

421
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.740
And you think, OK, these are very good skill sets.

422
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.160
I want all my team to have them.

423
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.360
Don't do them because it ticks a box in a program.

424
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:56.540
Do them because they're right for you and make sure that throughout everything you do, that you keep coming back to your own customer obsession.

425
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.200
You know, AWS is customer obsessed, but you need to be even more focused on your own customer obsession.

426
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.960
You are not AWS or Azure or any of these other people.

427
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.740
You are fundamentally your own independent consultancy.

428
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.800
And that's what your clients are relying on, right?

429
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.420
If they want to hear the sales pitch, they can go direct to the providers themselves.

430
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.480
If they want to hear the unvarnished truth and the warts and all version of it,

431
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.380
they're going to come to somebody like fourTheorem.

432
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.400
Make sure you treasure that value and you respect that relationship between yourself and your customer.

433
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:30.500
And that things don't become confused and you're not effectively just a sales agent for somebody else.

434
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.000
Maintain your own integrity.

435
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.480
So much great advice in there, Fiona.

436
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.080
Thanks a lot for joining us.

437
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:43.000
For me, it was great to shift away from the trivial technical topics towards the more important themes of people and finance.

438
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.900
It's always great to hear your insight.

439
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.960
So for people out there who would like to hear more, where should they find you?

440
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.720
How can they connect?

441
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.700
Come find me on LinkedIn.

442
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.840
I'd love to connect.

443
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.000
We'll chat.

444
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.400
Okay.

445
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.420
Brilliant.

446
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.680
Well, listen, thanks again, Fiona.

447
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.820
And thanks everyone for listening.

448
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.060
We're going to be back actually with more special guests in the near future,

449
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.700
as well as some of our usual technical ramblings.

450
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.060
If you haven't already subscribed to the podcast or our YouTube channel,

451
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.580
make sure you do now so you'll get notified when new episodes are released.

452
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.840
And let all your friends know that we're broadening out our subject matter

453
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.460
and it's really well worthwhile subscribing.

454
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.800
Take care and we'll see you in the next one.
