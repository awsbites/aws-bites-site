00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Happy 2025 to all the listeners of AWS Bites podcast.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.220
We are back from the holidays, recharged,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.420
and ready to dive into another fascinating topic

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.640
in the world of cloud computing and AWS.

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.760
My name is Luciano, and today I'm joined by Eoin

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080
to discuss a subject that we get asked about all the time.

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.100
How do I become a cloud architect?

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.480
And this is really important because the start of a new year

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.220
is the perfect time for resolutions and career shifts,

10
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.660
which makes it the ideal moment to explore

11
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.600
this exciting and rewarding career path.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.940
While we don't claim to have all the perfect formula

13
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.440
to make you the perfect architect,

14
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.660
we are excited to share our personal experiences,

15
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.260
discuss the journey that led us to become cloud architects,

16
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040
and outline what we believe are the key skills and traits

17
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.300
that are essential for aspiring cloud architects.

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.060
We'll map out a practical roadmap,

19
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560
and we'll try to give you some of the details

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.260
that should guide you from zero to cloud architect in 2025.

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.600
And we will also try towards the end

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.700
to answer some commonly asked questions.

23
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.940
So let's tackle those new year resolution,

24
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.320
and let's jump right in.

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.080

visit us at fourtheorem.com,

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.780
and let's work together to make your vision a reality.

35
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.280
Okay, so before getting started,

36
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.940
I want to share some disclaimers just to set the stage.

37
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.580
We are experts on AWS,

38
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.540
and therefore this episode, of course,

39
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.060
is going to be focused on AWS.

40
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.000
Although this concept,

41
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.620
this topic of becoming a cloud architect,

42
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.420
of course, goes beyond just AWS.

43
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.140
Everything we're sharing today,

44
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.360
you can probably take most of it

45
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.500
and also apply it if you are exploring a career

46
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.260
for other cloud providers.

47
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.760
Maybe that's Google, maybe that's Azure,

48
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.740
maybe that's something else.

49
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140
Hopefully, what we can share today

50
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.620
is mostly going to apply to all of that as well.

51
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.880
Now, becoming a cloud architect

52
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.440
isn't really or necessarily a straight path.

53
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.420
There are probably many, many different trajectories

54
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.800
that you can take to land there.

55
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.900
It's also a relatively new specialization.

56
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.360
We don't even think there is like

57
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.020
a canonical educational path

58
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.040
if you want to go through like a university

59
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.860
and just come out as a cloud architect.

60
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.340
We don't believe that that exists today.

61
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.960
So what we can do is we'll try to share our opinion

62
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800
and our experience.

63
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.080
And hopefully after listening to this episode,

64
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.660
you'll know enough

65
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.480
and you can explore a little bit of the topic more

66
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.460
and eventually come up with a more complete view

67
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.020
and some kind of path that you can start to walk

68
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.840
to get closer to this goal.

69
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.100
As always, this is just the starting point

70
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.760
for our conversation.

71
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.020
So we are going to encourage you to ask any questions

72
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.020
or leave comments, share your experience.

73
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.880
And we want to turn this into something

74
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.540
that is driven by everyone

75
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.040
and not just by our opinion.

76
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.500
So please reach out.

77
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.100
Where do we start, Eoin?

78
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.340
Well, before we get into it, we could talk about why you might do it.

79
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.200
You might have your own motivation,

80
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.200
but in case you didn't,

81
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.620
we took a look at some market research as preparation.

82
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.380
There's a Gartner report

83
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.180
on the cloud professional services market.

84
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.560
And it estimates that cloud professional services,

85
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.860
of which this is a big part,

86
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.760
was valued at around $22 billion in 2023

87
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.200
and growing 16% every year,

88
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.280
expected to grow at that rate

89
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.500
for the next decade approximately.

90
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.340
And this growth is driven by a few different factors.

91
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.380
Of course, the increasing adoption of cloud computing,

92
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.200
governments and public sectors

93
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600
doing all sorts of digital transformation initiatives

94
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600
to catch up on their legacy tech,

95
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.620
integration of AI and IoT

96
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.780
into industries like financial services,

97
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.020
and of course,

98
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.660
just increasing internet connectivity all over the world.

99
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.380
So for aspiring cloud architects,

100
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.140
this growth really leads to a booming demand for expertise,

101
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.580
especially in large-scale cloud deployments

102
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.980
and customized solutions.

103
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.000
Because it's a growing market,

104
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.340
lots of people are going to be doing

105
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.260
this kind of activity for the first time.

106
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.680
So people who've done it before

107
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.120
and have the skills to guide people along the path

108
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.520
are going to be very valuable.

109
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.600
So all in all,

110
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.980
if you find this kind of work interesting,

111
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.740
there should be many,

112
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.880
many appealing career opportunities.

113
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.220
So maybe let's just think about

114
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.620
what does it mean to be a cloud architect?

115
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.460
If you look at Google Cloud,

116
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.240
they've got a definition.

117
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.860
Defining a cloud architect

118
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.440
as an IT expert responsible for developing,

119
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.000
implementing and managing

120
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.800
an organization's cloud architecture.

121
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440
So I don't know if that really tells us

122
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
what we want to know,

123
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.940
but maybe we can go a bit deeper.

124
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.380
So a cloud architect should really understand

125
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.140
the specific characteristics of cloud environments,

126
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.020
because we're not just talking

127
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.100
about architecture in general.

128
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.420
That means crafting cloud architectures

129
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.380
and strategies that not only meet present needs,

130
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.480
but are optimized for future scalability,

131
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.560
performance, cost, security,

132
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.640
all of those pillars.

133
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.560
So what it means then is that

134
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.180
as a cloud architect,

135
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.560
you should understand

136
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.100
long-term business requirements

137
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.140
and be able to think about

138
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.360
what the architecture

139
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.220
and the cloud architecture means

140
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.640
and a strategy that can fulfill

141
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.140
those requirements today

142
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.680
but also iteratively

143
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.200
as it evolves towards that future.

144
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.880
But as cloud platforms,

145
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.160
your version one cloud platform

146
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.120
is always simpler

147
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.920
than it becomes over time.

148
00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.040
They evolve.

149
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.540
Architectures will become

150
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.940
more complex and diverse.

151
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.180
And then you have each cloud provider

152
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.060
offering lots of different managed services.

153
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.180
So this really means

154
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.060
that cloud architects

155
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.100
do need to understand

156
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.140
like foundational architectural patterns,

157
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.720
which we'll talk a little bit more

158
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.360
about later,

159
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.560
but also be well-versed

160
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.600
in specific services

161
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.240
and trade-offs

162
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.700
for a chosen cloud provider.

163
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.840
And this is generally

164
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.860
why we believe

165
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.240
it's usually important

166
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.740
to focus on one cloud provider.

167
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.560
If you just take AWS alone,

168
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.960
it has a massive surface area

169
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.800
and it's unlikely

170
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.920
for one individual

171
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.660
to be able to master

172
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.900
everything in AWS alone.

173
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.300
So imagine trying

174
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.840
to be proficient

175
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.020
with multiple cloud providers

176
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.240
at the same level of expertise.

177
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.560
it's, yeah,

178
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.620
not really going to happen.

179
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.000
Yeah, so if I can try

180
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.340
to summarize what you just said

181
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.600
and maybe add a little bit more,

182
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.000
what we are saying

183
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800
is that a cloud architect

184
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.140
should be able to understand

185
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.740
traditional system architecture

186
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.860
and distributed system,

187
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.460
then have an in-depth knowledge

188
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.720
of a specific cloud provider,

189
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.120
let's say AWS, Azure, Google,

190
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.440
whatever you prefer,

191
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.200
but pick one and stick to it.

192
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.440
Also probably needs to have

193
00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.740
some good programming skills.

194
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.000
Doesn't have to be

195
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.400
the most well-versed

196
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.200
software engineer,

197
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.680
but at least should be proficient

198
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.580
with a scripted language

199
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.700
like Python or JavaScript

200
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.020
to be able to write

201
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.860
some kind of automation

202
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.400
or maybe write some code

203
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.000
in terms of application code

204
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.960
whenever it's needed.

205
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.480
And then there are a mix

206
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.400
of foundational pieces of knowledge

207
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.320
that I think are required,

208
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.880
for instance,

209
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.100
networking concepts,

210
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.440
what is TCP, IP, DNS, HTTP,

211
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.200
what a CDN does,

212
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.220
all that kind of stuff

213
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.860
becomes more and more important

214
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.700
as you start to build

215
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.220
more advanced architecture.

216
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.660
Security, we mentioned,

217
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.100
is always a requirement

218
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.980
that's coming up

219
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.600
and these days even more so.

220
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.800
And that includes understanding

221
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.220
identity, access management,

222
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.300
encryption, again,

223
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.860
networking in the sense

224
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.920
of making network secure.

225
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.600
Compliance as well

226
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.280
is another topic

227
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.400
that always comes up,

228
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.360
especially if you work

229
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.800
in highly regulated industries.

230
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.360
So an architect needs to have

231
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.760
at least a basic understanding

232
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.600
of what the different

233
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.900
compliance regulations

234
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.320
are kind of forcing you

235
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.440
to do in your designs,

236
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.000
but also operative systems

237
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.880
because of course,

238
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.560
this is especially true

239
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.080
for Linux

240
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080
because it tends to be

241
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.180
the most used one

242
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.760
when it comes to the cloud

243
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.520
and application servers.

244
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.280
So you probably need

245
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.760
to understand

246
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.100
some degree of all of that

247
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.780
because almost every time

248
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.660
when you're doing compute,

249
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.940
although today,

250
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.220
maybe if you're using servers,

251
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.340
there are several degrees

252
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.960
of abstraction,

253
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.520
but then you always end up

254
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.920
needing some of that knowledge.

255
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.500
And that means

256
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.240
you need to understand

257
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.200
what are the basics

258
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.160
of the operative system,

259
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.620
how does a process start,

260
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.520
memories versus storage.

261
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.300
probably you need

262
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.420
to understand about containers

263
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.160
because that's also

264
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.340
another common abstraction

265
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.540
that you might end up using.

266
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.560
Even if you're using,

267
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.700
I don't know,

268
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.580
Fargate, for instance,

269
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.400
which tends to be

270
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.220
pretty abstracted,

271
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.240
you still need to understand

272
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.360
containers really well.

273
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.380
And even more so

274
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.220
if you end up using

275
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.040
something like Kubernetes,

276
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.740
for example.

277
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.000
Then data storage

278
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.680
and databases,

279
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.920
that probably means

280
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.820
understanding the difference

281
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.080
between SQL and NoSQL,

282
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.380
or maybe even thinking

283
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.300
about big data

284
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.060
and data lakes,

285
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.960
how do you design for those

286
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.840
and when do you need

287
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.000
one versus the other.

288
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.860
And of course,

289
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080
the main point is

290
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.520
that you don't need

291
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.120
to be a master

292
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.220
in all of these topics

293
00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.840
because of course

294
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.340
there is a massive surface there

295
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.980
and it's going to take you

296
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.760
years and years

297
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.580
to become proficient

298
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.400
with all of them

299
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.920
and probably even unfeasible

300
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.120
to become extremely proficient

301
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.940
in all these areas.

302
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.000
But at least you need

303
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.460
to understand the basic concepts

304
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.560
and try to think

305
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.580
what are the pros and cons

306
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.680
of all the different approaches

307
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.620
and be able to come up

308
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.300
with a design

309
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.560
that makes sense

310
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.100
when you bring

311
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.580
all these different pieces together.

312
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.200
Of course,

313
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.780
you're not going to be

314
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.320
working alone,

315
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.420
you will be working in a team

316
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.600
and you'll be trying

317
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.720
to draw expertise

318
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.760
from all the components

319
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.380
in your team.

320
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.380
So probably you're going

321
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:26.740
to have people

322
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.400
that are experienced

323
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.100
that really,

324
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.620
really experienced

325
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.440
with databases,

326
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.040
for example.

327
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.320
You will be drawing

328
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.000
their experience

329
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.700
whenever you need

330
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.460
to design something

331
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.320
at a lower level

332
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.860
and you need more expertise.

333
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:36.940
And that's something

334
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.400
that of course

335
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.180
you need to apply

336
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.440
at all the different areas.

337
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.900
Which kind of leads us

338
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.580
to the next part

339
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.560
which is there are

340
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.640
lots of soft skills

341
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.780
that are required as well

342
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.600
because of course

343
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.400
you need to work

344
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.440
with a lot of different people

345
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.540
and this is not just technical

346
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.820
but most often

347
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.680
you also need to work

348
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.460
with business people

349
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.440
which means that

350
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.900
you need to have

351
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.440
some degree

352
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.260
of business acumen.

353
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.200
So you need to

354
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.880
understand business requirements

355
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.500
and objectives.

356
00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.820
So you need to understand

357
00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.700
how a business works

358
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.000
and why certain decisions

359
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.060
are made in a business.

360
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.460
And then from the technology

361
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.880
perspective,

362
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.600
what can you do

363
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.020
to support those decisions

364
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.880
short term versus long term?

365
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.120
And this involves sometimes

366
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.120
taking kind of short term tactics

367
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.100
but at the same time

368
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.740
having a vision

369
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.860
for a long term strategy

370
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.020
that allows the business

371
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.080
to succeed long term.

372
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.020
All of that stuff

373
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.720
requires good communication skills.

374
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.120
So can you talk technically

375
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.500
with other technical stakeholders

376
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.260
but can you talk

377
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.320
a little bit less technically

378
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.440
with business stakeholders

379
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.140
and make sure

380
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.260
that you can bridge the gap

381
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.280
between those two worlds

382
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.740
which effectively means

383
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.880
communicate clearly.

384
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.860
It's like one of the main things

385
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.820
that you can develop

386
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.640
from a soft skill perspective.

387
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.140
And in more general terms

388
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.960
we can also talk about

389
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.680
problem solving.

390
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.620
At the end of the day

391
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.140
architecture is

392
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.020
one of the many ways

393
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.860
that you can think about

394
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.540
problem solving in technology.

395
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.640
It's maybe

396
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.580
at a little bit

397
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.420
of a larger scale

398
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.020
when it's compared

399
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.040
to a single application.

400
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.780
When you're thinking

401
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.500
about architecture

402
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.280
we are solving

403
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.360
a problem

404
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.480
generally a business problem

405
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.620
with an entire system

406
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.380
in this case

407
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.960
in the cloud.

408
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.460
So being able

409
00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.380
to understand

410
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.260
what is exactly

411
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.580
the problem

412
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.320
we are trying to solve

413
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.020
and what are

414
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.760
the main challenges

415
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760
and then build from there

416
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.540
I think is going to be

417
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.120
a very very important skill.

418
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.720
One of the questions you might have is

419
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.320
then if you have

420
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.100
an architect role

421
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.700
who is responsible

422
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.400
for architecture?

423
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.140
Is it always just

424
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.880
the architect role?

425
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.420
Do you have to be

426
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.320
an architect to architect

427
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.300
or is architecture

428
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.280
like a collaborative

429
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.560
function of an entire team?

430
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.060
And if so

431
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.080
what's the role

432
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.500
of the architect

433
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.160
within that team?

434
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.960
Is it a final decision maker

435
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.300
or is it a facilitator

436
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.640
of architectural decisions?

437
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.460
Now while a designated

438
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.460
architect

439
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.260
with the official title

440
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.720
often leads the charge

441
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.160
decisions impact

442
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.840
the entire team

443
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.940
and beyond the team

444
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.900
therefore the entire team

445
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.520
should participate

446
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.200
in that process.

447
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:39.760
That's something

448
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.620
we would really believe

449
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.180
very strongly.

450
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.560
Different roles

451
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.800
and different backgrounds

452
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.240
and levels of experience

453
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.820
and even looking

454
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.360
at developers,

455
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.040
operations,

456
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.000
security engineers,

457
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.440
testers,

458
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.040
product owners

459
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.140
they all bring unique

460
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.300
insights that are crucial

461
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.180
for creating robust

462
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.500
and effective architectures.

463
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.800
Even if an architect

464
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.220
has the most experience

465
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.940
it doesn't mean

466
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.880
that other people

467
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.200
on the team

468
00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.980
don't have experiences

469
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980
they don't have.

470
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.960
So it is important

471
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.700
to be open

472
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.040
and regard it

473
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.120
as a collaborative activity.

474
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.940
You have to resist

475
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.600
the idea of an ivory tower

476
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:07.960
architect

477
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960
that makes the decisions

478
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.260
and hands them down

479
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.360
for teams to implement.

480
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.800
And that way

481
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.500
isn't going to be

482
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.160
a very productive

483
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.240
or a very enjoyable

484
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.800
place to work.

485
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.720
Even if you're not

486
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.060
an architect

487
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.820
you should be able

488
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.380
to contribute significantly

489
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.600
to architectural decisions

490
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.360
through your daily work.

491
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.380
Even as a junior developer

492
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.240
you should start

493
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.180
to try and think about this

494
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.220
and trying to understand

495
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.740
how can I contribute here.

496
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.940
If you have something

497
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.780
to say that you feel

498
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.860
is relevant to the architecture

499
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.540
you should be open

500
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.160
to doing that

501
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.140
and your organisation

502
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.780
should be open

503
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.620
to you doing that too.

504
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.380
When everybody participates

505
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.500
then you get this sense

506
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.260
of collective ownership

507
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.120
we've talked a good few

508
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.300
times about before

509
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.320
and responsibility

510
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.160
for the architecture

511
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.780
so you've got a lot

512
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.480
more buy-in

513
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.300
a lot more satisfaction

514
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.780
and you end up

515
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.300
with a much more

516
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.600
effective implementation

517
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.540
and maintenance

518
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.220
into the future

519
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:51.740
then as well.

520
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.120
Of course

521
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.940
if one person

522
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.220
has the architectural view

523
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.000
and every decision

524
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.740
has to go through them

525
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.300
you end up with a bottleneck

526
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.040
that can slow down

527
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.080
development significantly

528
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.540
and make the architecture brittle.

529
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.740
A team-led approach

530
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.520
will mitigate that.

531
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.120
So in a way

532
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.560
you could say

533
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.340
that everyone could

534
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.640
and should contribute

535
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.080
to the cloud architecture efforts.

536
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.080
It's not a solo act

537
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.280
it is more of a team sport.

538
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.560
What's more important

539
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.240
for an architect

540
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.020
in the context

541
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.780
is to set the vision

542
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.840
and help to get mutual agreement

543
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.600
on what it is

544
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.300
you're trying to achieve

545
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.580
in order to provide value

546
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.080
to think about

547
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.960
the architectural strategy

548
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.980
how you're doing it

549
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.080
and how it's going to evolve

550
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.860
into the future

551
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.940
as business needs evolve

552
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.160
and then things like

553
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.060
setting guiding principles

554
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.000
like scalability

555
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.580
security

556
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.500
maintainability

557
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.580
and other illities

558
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.680
that can guide

559
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.500
teams decisions.

560
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.880
It can also be guiding

561
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.040
frameworks for deciding

562
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.680
on technologies

563
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.720
to make it easier

564
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.280
for people

565
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.040
to not get stuck

566
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.960
with analysis paralysis

567
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.720
every time they need

568
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.520
to pick up a new tool

569
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.240
to do something

570
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.300
and also maybe encouraging

571
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.020
people to avoid

572
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.220
technology sprawl

573
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.880
by having unique decisions

574
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.140
every time you go

575
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.180
to look at

576
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.320
answering a problem.

577
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.400
You know,

578
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.580
architecture fundamentally

579
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.500
it's like a game

580
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.100
of trade-offs

581
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.940
and I think

582
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.100
more experienced architects

583
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.140
understand

584
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.540
that there's always

585
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.340
trade-offs in everything

586
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.640
and that includes

587
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.740
when it comes to

588
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.340
decision-making

589
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.860
and collaboration

590
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.620
so you have to

591
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.240
kind of understand

592
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.980
and read the room

593
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.460
as to when it's

594
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.820
a good time

595
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.660
to get people's

596
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.400
opinion on board

597
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.060
and spend more time

598
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.440
discussing

599
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.720
and also be able

600
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.200
to say

601
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.620
okay,

602
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.720
the time for discussion

603
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.500
has happened now

604
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:13.980
and we need to

605
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.680
actually work together

606
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.340
towards a decision

607
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.380
and facilitate

608
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.680
that discussion

609
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.560
moving towards

610
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.020
a conclusion

611
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.700
so that you can

612
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.620
actually get to work

613
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.440
and so there's a lot

614
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440
of skills involved

615
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.780
in there

616
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.440
but a lot of that

617
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.380
will come with experience

618
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.360
so if you are

619
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.260
an aspiring architect

620
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.820
that means that

621
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.600
even with your current role

622
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.160
you're already

623
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.760
getting experience

624
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.420
and you could probably

625
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.380
find opportunities

626
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.300
to do architect stuff.

627
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.260
Maybe we can take

628
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:34.920
now a little bit

629
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.340
of a segue

630
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.460
and share

631
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.860
some of our stories

632
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.960
how did we become

633
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.700
cloud architects

634
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.940
actually we do have

635
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.640
an entire episode

636
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.520
dedicated to our

637
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.260
personal journey

638
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.920
that led us

639
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.400
to become

640
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.780
experience in AWS

641
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.520
and eventually

642
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.940
become AWS cloud architects

643
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.960
so we'll defer

644
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.460
to that one

645
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.060
for the details

646
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.700
but I think it's still

647
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.580
useful to share

648
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.080
a little bit

649
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.800
of a quick summary

650
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.700
just to give you

651
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.280
two practical examples

652
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.580
of how can you

653
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.580
end up becoming

654
00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.980
a cloud architect

655
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.980
and it will

656
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.960
might be very different

657
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.340
for you

658
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.240
but at least you have

659
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.260
some reference points

660
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.020
and you can draw

661
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.260
hopefully some inspirations

662
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.880
by the way

663
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.400
that episode

664
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.380
is episode 91

665
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.320
and we will have

666
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.240
the link in the show notes

667
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.320
if you want to deep dive

668
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.660
on our personal careers

669
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.240
I'm gonna take a stab

670
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.220
starting my one

671
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.680
I think I consider myself

672
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.200
very lucky

673
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.260
because I discovered

674
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.620
my passion for coding

675
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.840
computers in general

676
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.740
when I was very young

677
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.540
at the age of 12

678
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.400
I was accidentally

679
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.180
playing with

680
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.640
a i386 computer

681
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.620
and I realized

682
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.460
there was QBasic

683
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.940
installed

684
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.160
and I happened to have

685
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.200
a book that was

686
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.920
describing like

687
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.940
how do you do

688
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.740
like an L award

689
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.560
and then how do you

690
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.620
draw a Christmas tree

691
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.020
this kind of silly things

692
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.000
that I eventually

693
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.480
got that eventually

694
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.340
got myself into

695
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.360
enjoying coding

696
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.140
and build this stuff

697
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.340
and I think since then

698
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.060
I never stopped

699
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.660
learning and I ended up

700
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.540
eventually starting

701
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.760
a career as a web developer

702
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.820
in between I was also

703
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.720
studying and I decided

704
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.580
to take a degree

705
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.440
in computer science

706
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.200
which is something

707
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.940
that I think helped me

708
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.180
to have a strong

709
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.400
foundation in programming

710
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.300
and software engineering

711
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300
in general

712
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.560
and I was also

713
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.280
working while studying

714
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.360
so I ended up

715
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.460
working in various

716
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.260
software engineering

717
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.540
and web development roles

718
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.220
and I continued that

719
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.500
of course after my degree

720
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.980
so I think I had

721
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.800
more of a decade

722
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.100
or something close to that

723
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.860
of experience

724
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.820
in different environments

725
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.700
as an employee

726
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.480
working for various companies

727
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.500
working as a freelance

728
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.940
I even had my own startup

729
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.180
which failed miserably

730
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.060
but that's an entirely

731
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.920
different story

732
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.740
that I'm not going to

733
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.280
cover today

734
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.500
and at some point

735
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.040
in my career

736
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.140
after all these things

737
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.400
I think was around 2016

738
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.900
I found myself

739
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.040
working in a small startup

740
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.060
that needed to build

741
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.020
a product in the cloud

742
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.940
and I think it was

743
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.020
quite a unique opportunity

744
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.460
for me

745
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.400
because in that team

746
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.540
which was a very small team

747
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.000
I think we were

748
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.920
like four developers

749
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.500
nobody really had

750
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.560
strong expertise

751
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.260
with the cloud

752
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.280
so we kind of had

753
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.260
to figure it out together

754
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.600
and deploy something

755
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.100
on AWS

756
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.760
which was a bit scary

757
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.000
because of course

758
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.080
we felt the responsibility

759
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.060
but at the same time

760
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.920
by taking the leap

761
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.140
it was the first step

762
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.040
for me to start to

763
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.160
learn and embrace

764
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.840
this new world

765
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.700
which I think

766
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.540
eventually led me

767
00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.920
to become an AWS expert

768
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.880
also fair to say

769
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880
that we were not

770
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.680
necessarily alone

771
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.200
all the time

772
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.020
we used a consulting company

773
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.760
that helped us

774
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.520
to kind of set

775
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.400
the foundation right

776
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.620
which is another reason

777
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.380
why you should consider

778
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:09.900
doing that

779
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.980
if you find yourself

780
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.000
in this situation

781
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.720
where you need

782
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.580
to do something on AWS

783
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.200
you don't necessarily

784
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.060
have all the expertise

785
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.560
in house

786
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.900
an external company

787
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.440
can help you

788
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.600
to set the foundation right

789
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.760
and quickly upskill

790
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.160
your team

791
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.700
so I found that experience

792
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.260
very useful

793
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.820
when I was

794
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.740
on the other side

795
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.380
at that time

796
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.380
so I guess

797
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.520
from that moment on

798
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.540
I always found myself

799
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.420
doing more and more

800
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:30.800
AWS

801
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.420
both as personal interest

802
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.080
but also because

803
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.900
I ended up working

804
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.920
in more companies

805
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.180
where we were

806
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.940
effectively shipping

807
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.760
more and more complex

808
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.980
products on AWS

809
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.800
and while I was doing that

810
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.480
I was trying to learn

811
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.220
as much as possible

812
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.260
not just about

813
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.460
building web apps

814
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.660
for the cloud

815
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.220
but also

816
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.120
how do you architect

817
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.560
entire systems

818
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.700
with multiple components

819
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.640
to run smoothly

820
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.160
in the cloud

821
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.120
in a secure way

822
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.220
scalable way

823
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.820
doing all the observability

824
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.840
all this kind of stuff

825
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.940
that I think eventually

826
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.000
is the main responsibility

827
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.900
of a cloud architect

828
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.400
so after I think

829
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:00.980
a few years

830
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.640
of all of that

831
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.280
probably about

832
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.260
four to five years

833
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.600
I joined for theorem

834
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.880
and at that point

835
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.040
I got an official title

836
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.780
of cloud architect

837
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.100
so thank you for theorem

838
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.720
for giving me the trust

839
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.820
but I want to say

840
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.920
that even though

841
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.140
now this is the title

842
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.100
I still get to code

843
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.960
almost every day

844
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.380
it's something

845
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.240
that I enjoy doing

846
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.980
and I think

847
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.540
it's a fundamental

848
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.880
thing for an architect

849
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.200
to still be able

850
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.720
to build

851
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.520
not just design

852
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.060
but actually

853
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.680
keep building

854
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.220
together

855
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:24.940
with the rest

856
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.340
of the team

857
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.360
so I think

858
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.440
it's one last thing

859
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.040
I want to mention

860
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.560
is that

861
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.880
throughout all this journey

862
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.000
I always looked

863
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.580
for opportunity

864
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.840
to do content creation

865
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.940
maybe just because

866
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.640
it's something else

867
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.620
that I enjoy doing

868
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.500
and but at the same time

869
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.660
maybe I didn't realize that

870
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.540
but I think that helped

871
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.080
a lot my journey

872
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.780
into becoming an architect

873
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.960
because in many ways

874
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.820
it kind of helped me

875
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.540
to develop

876
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.000
communication skills

877
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.860
I ended up delivering

878
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.220
talks at various conferences

879
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.080
I even co-authored

880
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.000
a couple of books

881
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.580
and I think all of this stuff

882
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.640
in a way or another

883
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.940
gives you the skills

884
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.460
that you need

885
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.360
when you need to communicate

886
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.040
in a verbal

887
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040
or in a written form

888
00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.920
with your peers

889
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.340
whether these are technical

890
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.800
or from the business side

891
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.820
I think that's something

892
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.660
you need to figure out

893
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.620
how do I improve

894
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.240
on that skill

895
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.960
and in my case

896
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.500
that was content creation

897
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.800
in the broader sense

898
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.640
this was maybe

899
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.240
a little bit longer

900
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.880
than I expected

901
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.640
but I'll switch to you Eoin

902
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.500
I don't know if we do it again next year

903
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.200
it'll be even longer

904
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.940
because the story

905
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.600
isn't finished yet

906
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.300
yeah I mean

907
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.120
I also have a

908
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.180
fairly privileged

909
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.980
and fortunate background

910
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.380
in that

911
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.360
got into programming early

912
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.640
and also studied

913
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.240
computer science

914
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.640
which really

915
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.300
you know

916
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.780
gave a good foundation

917
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.620
I didn't appreciate it

918
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.320
at the time at all

919
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.240
but never really thought

920
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.040
much about architecture

921
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.280
until I got into industry

922
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.080
and started working

923
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.100
because it was all about

924
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.320
programming and software development

925
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.340
and I didn't really understand

926
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.740
what a software architect was

927
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.300
we had some

928
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.480
when I was in college

929
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.340
did start learning

930
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.260
about design patterns

931
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.740
and pattern languages

932
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.300
and how all that stuff evolved

933
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.280
but it's not really

934
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.060
until you understand

935
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.200
especially building

936
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.940
larger systems

937
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.200
which you don't always

938
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.940
get exposure to

939
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.540
early on

940
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.860
actually in my career

941
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.340
I think one of the things

942
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.780
that shaped my biases

943
00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.500
that I have now

944
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.040
was for many years

945
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.000
I built a lot of systems

946
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.840
and most of them

947
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.140
a remarkable number of them

948
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.880
never made it

949
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.560
really into the real world

950
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.420
and that can happen

951
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:07.860
you know

952
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.140
you can

953
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.920
a lot of software

954
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.700
does not make it

955
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.440
into production

956
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.340
or doesn't make it

957
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.560
either because it's in a startup

958
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.400
or because it's

959
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.080
you work on

960
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.780
versions of systems

961
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.980
or innovative projects

962
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.940
that just don't make it

963
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.760
out into the real world

964
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.900
and after

965
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.820
you know

966
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.840
a good few years

967
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.240
in the industry

968
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:23.760
I looked back

969
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.040
and thought

970
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.420
wow

971
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.320
like there's actually

972
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.620
very little of the work

973
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.640
that I've been involved in

974
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.520
that really made it

975
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.240
into the real world

976
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.300
and that kind of led me to

977
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.020
I suppose

978
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.980
more of a

979
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.940
contrarian

980
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.800
approach

981
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.540
as an architect

982
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.100
where

983
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.820
always question the value

984
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.440
of what we're doing

985
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.220
before we're doing it

986
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.140
and wonder if it's

987
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.800
really worth doing

988
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.320
and because I just

989
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.520
after a time I said

990
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.140
okay I'm going to have

991
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.120
to flip this ratio

992
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.240
and ensure that the

993
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.300
systems I work on

994
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.940
most of them

995
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.920
are going to see

996
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.520
the light of day

997
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.120
and not end up

998
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.140
on a shelf gathering dust

999
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.400
after working as a developer

1000
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.380
for years

1001
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.780
I was constantly thinking

1002
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.580
of well

1003
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.780
I should think about

1004
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.960
becoming a senior developer

1005
00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.880
and then an architect

1006
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.800
as if there's this

1007
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.580
natural progression

1008
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.200
and you're just

1009
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.000
ticking off boxes

1010
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.520
on the way

1011
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.780
and when I look back

1012
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.780
now like I'm still

1013
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.100
developing as a developer

1014
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.420
as there is no

1015
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.560
milestone really

1016
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.440
I can say I've reached

1017
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.260
at any different point

1018
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.220
it's just after a bit

1019
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.760
of experience

1020
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.960
you feel more and more

1021
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.400
comfortable

1022
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.100
doing all these

1023
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.200
different roles

1024
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.920
and I don't feel

1025
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.620
like I'm there yet

1026
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.620
in any regard

1027
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.700
on any of these things

1028
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.720
it's just constantly

1029
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.180
learning

1030
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.040
and either becoming

1031
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.520
more comfortable

1032
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:26.920
with them

1033
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.700
or just getting more

1034
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.600
uncomfortable with

1035
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.320
imposter syndrome

1036
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.120
or not knowing

1037
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.760
what you're doing

1038
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.640
that always helps

1039
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:31.840
right

1040
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.280
because some

1041
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.800
ultimately

1042
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.340
architecture is often

1043
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:34.940
just a question

1044
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.840
of making decisions

1045
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.420
and being able

1046
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.060
to make a decision

1047
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.160
doesn't just mean

1048
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:39.480
that you know

1049
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.940
what you're doing

1050
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.720
it means that

1051
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.620
you've got the ability

1052
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.360
to say okay

1053
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.280
there's different

1054
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:43.780
trade-offs here

1055
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.240
but let's just

1056
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.660
pick something

1057
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.300
and run with it

1058
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.200
and then if it

1059
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.520
doesn't work

1060
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.060
we'll try something

1061
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.340
else

1062
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.420
I don't know

1063
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.380
if that was

1064
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.740
a clearer description

1065
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.540
of my journey

1066
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.820
but that's certainly

1067
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.580
what comes to mind

1068
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:54.960
right now

1069
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.200
yeah it's super interesting

1070
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.140
I like that

1071
00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.640
you took a slightly

1072
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.140
step-by-step approach

1073
00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.220
and tried to give

1074
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.000
a little bit more

1075
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.800
of a guidance

1076
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.700
on what are the

1077
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.340
things that matter

1078
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.020
or at least

1079
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.480
what are the things

1080
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.900
that matter

1081
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.560
in your journey

1082
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.160
that led you

1083
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.060
where you are today

1084
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.380
but let's get back

1085
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:09.960
now into something

1086
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.500
a little bit more

1087
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.900
practical

1088
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.860
because we want

1089
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.380
to share

1090
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.480
a potential path

1091
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.660
and some resources

1092
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.640
that might help you

1093
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.440
if you are really

1094
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.160
decided now

1095
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.940
that architecture

1096
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.700
cloud architecture

1097
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.340
is what you want

1098
00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:19.820
to achieve

1099
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.600
this year

1100
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.380
starting this year

1101
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.260
what are the steps

1102
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:22.900
that you can follow

1103
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.340
and again

1104
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.280
remember the disclaimer

1105
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.380
that this is just

1106
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:25.860
a suggestion

1107
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.700
it's not necessarily

1108
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.840
the most complete

1109
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.780
or the most structured

1110
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.120
path

1111
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.100
just things

1112
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.940
that you can draw from

1113
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.800
so one thing

1114
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.240
that is worth

1115
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.640
mentioning

1116
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.340
is that

1117
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.400
if you are already

1118
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.320
a software developer

1119
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.340
maybe already

1120
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.120
working in the cloud

1121
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.960
you are already

1122
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.520
on a great path

1123
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.760
so that's a great

1124
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.400
starting point

1125
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.360
because that means

1126
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.140
that you are already

1127
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.120
getting lots of experience

1128
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.000
and this is setting you up

1129
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.440
for making the leap

1130
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.040
and becoming

1131
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.980
a cloud architect

1132
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.180
so one thing

1133
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.080
that you could start to do

1134
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.640
and you are probably

1135
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.200
already doing

1136
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.660
maybe without realizing it

1137
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.140
is trying to gain

1138
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.020
more experience

1139
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.980
with as many

1140
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.620
solutions

1141
00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.080
systems

1142
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.500
architecture

1143
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.080
environments

1144
00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.720
as possible

1145
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.780
because effectively

1146
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.540
being able to recognize

1147
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.780
different options

1148
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.840
and the pros

1149
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.200
and cons

1150
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.820
of every option

1151
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.720
is one of the main

1152
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.140
qualities

1153
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.860
that an architect

1154
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.540
needs to have

1155
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.500
because it kind of

1156
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.200
gives you that

1157
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.460
breadth and depth

1158
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.900
of understanding

1159
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.980
of how different

1160
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.660
systems work

1161
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.300
and how can they

1162
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.300
be connected together

1163
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.000
but of course

1164
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.920
this is not

1165
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.340
necessarily a starting point

1166
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.100
maybe you are starting

1167
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.840
from somewhere else

1168
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.400
maybe you are even

1169
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.260
transitioning from

1170
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.320
a totally different career

1171
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.600
that's still fine

1172
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.200
it doesn't mean

1173
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.280
you cannot achieve the goal

1174
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.080
the goal is still

1175
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.760
totally achievable

1176
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.000
but maybe you need

1177
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.020
to follow a little bit

1178
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.700
of a more structured

1179
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.280
approach

1180
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.440
where you need to figure out

1181
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440
exactly what to learn

1182
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.000
and then of course

1183
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.440
as you keep learning

1184
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.400
and as you keep practicing

1185
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.620
eventually you will have

1186
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.260
enough confidence

1187
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.060
and enough knowledge

1188
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.240
to be on the job

1189
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.760
with the title

1190
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.980
so of course

1191
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.000
this is going to take some time

1192
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.680
it's not going to happen

1193
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.700
everything on day one

1194
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.800
so be patient

1195
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.120
and try to dedicate

1196
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.040
a little bit of time

1197
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.600
consistently

1198
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.220
and eventually

1199
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.080
you'll get there

1200
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.280
my other suggestion

1201
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.540
is that there is always

1202
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.460
a struggle between

1203
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.480
theory and practice

1204
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.660
it's difficult to find

1205
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.300
a good balance

1206
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.380
but I think it is important

1207
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.180
to have both

1208
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.640
some people just focus

1209
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.660
totally on the practice

1210
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.660
and they miss some

1211
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.100
important theory aspects

1212
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.000
also the opposite can happen

1213
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.160
you do only theory

1214
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.060
you think you know everything

1215
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.700
and then when you try

1216
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.640
to do something in practice

1217
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.280
you don't even know

1218
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:10.860
where to start

1219
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.860
so trying to find a balance

1220
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.960
and my suggestion would be

1221
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.260
learn something

1222
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.480
from the theory

1223
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.520
but in small steps

1224
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.600
and then try to have

1225
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.620
practical experience

1226
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.400
as quick as possible

1227
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.040
to consolidate those learnings

1228
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.080
so with that being said

1229
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.500
let's focus on

1230
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.400
some resources

1231
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.280
that can guide you

1232
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.880
along the way

1233
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.700
I think

1234
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.980
if you want to focus

1235
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.880
just on cloud

1236
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.100
and architecture aspects

1237
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.480
there are two great resources

1238
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.460
that I want to suggest

1239
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.600
one is the AWS

1240
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.780
well-architected framework

1241
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.780
something that we have

1242
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.760
been speaking about before

1243
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.940
there is an entire episode

1244
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.860
episode 68

1245
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.060
that talks about

1246
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:41.580
the structure

1247
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.840
of the well-architected framework

1248
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.540
what it does

1249
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.300
and why AWS created this

1250
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.780
but just as a quick summary

1251
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.420
it's effectively

1252
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.000
a piece of documentation

1253
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.340
with lots of resources

1254
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.080
for architects

1255
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.040
and aspiring architects

1256
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.060
that is structured

1257
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.360
in multiple pillars

1258
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.560
covering things

1259
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.580
like operational excellence

1260
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.720
so how do you run

1261
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.660
and monitor systems

1262
00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.320
security

1263
00:23:59.320 --> 00:23:59.960
reliability

1264
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.820
for instance

1265
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.480
how do you design

1266
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.000
for failure

1267
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.960
performance

1268
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.700
cost optimization

1269
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.860
and the more recent one

1270
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.460
is sustainability

1271
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.640
so how do you design

1272
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.780
systems that are sustainable

1273
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.980
so this is a great resource

1274
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.000
absolutely recommended

1275
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.340
so go and check it out

1276
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.160
whenever you have time

1277
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.740
the other one

1278
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.540
is actually from Azure

1279
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.940
so maybe a little bit surprising

1280
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.900
for people that follow

1281
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.460
this podcast

1282
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.480
but I think it's a very

1283
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.160
very good resource

1284
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.900
so absolutely worth a shout

1285
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.860
and it's called

1286
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.400
Azure Cloud Design Patterns

1287
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.460
and it's just a documentation page

1288
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.700
in the Azure website

1289
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.360
we'll have a link

1290
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.980
in the show notes

1291
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.320
which illustrates

1292
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.000
a few common design fallacies

1293
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.060
that people do

1294
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.100
in regular software engineering

1295
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.680
but I would say

1296
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.320
even more so

1297
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.900
in the cloud

1298
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.760
which are things like

1299
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.740
assuming that the network

1300
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.640
is always reliable

1301
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.340
bandwidth is always infinite

1302
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.920
topology never changes

1303
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.660
all these kind of

1304
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.460
common mistakes

1305
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.160
that when you actually

1306
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.680
start to think

1307
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.840
that those assumptions

1308
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.620
are not true

1309
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.780
actually that's when

1310
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.700
you start to go deeper

1311
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.600
into your architecture

1312
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.000
and think

1313
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.340
okay

1314
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.340
if this thing

1315
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.100
is never going to be

1316
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.240
100% reliable

1317
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.440
how can I design

1318
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.020
my solution

1319
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.140
to also be

1320
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.460
somewhat available

1321
00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.820
when things are not

1322
00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.740
reliable around it

1323
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.520
and of course

1324
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.400
it's not an easy

1325
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.980
thing to do

1326
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.860
but just thinking

1327
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.300
about it

1328
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.820
is going to give you

1329
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.400
lots of ideas

1330
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.960
and then of course

1331
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.360
you can look at the industry

1332
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.920
and figure out

1333
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.680
how other people

1334
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.120
are solving

1335
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.960
this kind of problems

1336
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.600
and that's why

1337
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.260
I also like

1338
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.400
this specific resource

1339
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.380
because it gives you

1340
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.980
a list of common

1341
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.020
architectural patterns

1342
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.740
that with very good

1343
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.820
descriptions and examples

1344
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.140
that you can quickly browse

1345
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.000
and just have a feeling

1346
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.880
for how many

1347
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.220
solutions already exist

1348
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.800
in the industry

1349
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.880
and you can often

1350
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.000
just take those solutions

1351
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.100
and combine them together

1352
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.620
to solve your specific problems

1353
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.640
and just to give you

1354
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.180
some examples

1355
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.020
I'm talking about

1356
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.860
for instance

1357
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.120
the anti-corruption layer

1358
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.060
CQRS

1359
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.940
orchestration

1360
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.820
versus choreography

1361
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.100
the request response

1362
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.740
patterns

1363
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.840
synchronous and asynchronous

1364
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.380
so all this stuff

1365
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.460
I think it's something

1366
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.440
that you will find yourself

1367
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.400
using every day

1368
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.160
when thinking about

1369
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.900
architectures

1370
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.680
distributed systems and kind of systems thinking

1371
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.560
system architecture

1372
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.500
is another important thing

1373
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.000
to think about

1374
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.140
cloud architectures

1375
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.160
or systems ultimately

1376
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.620
and you need to connect

1377
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.520
different building blocks

1378
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.480
to come up with a scale

1379
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:58.940
of a solution

1380
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.020
so that really means

1381
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.520
not just for cloud architecture

1382
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.580
but any modern architecture

1383
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.820
understanding messaging

1384
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.920
like pull versus push

1385
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.580
event brushes

1386
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.340
queuing systems

1387
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.820
we've a suite of episodes

1388
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.040
on those for AWS

1389
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.980
and then also fault tolerance

1390
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.260
for inter-process communication

1391
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.540
data persistence

1392
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.160
retries

1393
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.940
item potency

1394
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.880
circuit breakers

1395
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.640
all that kind of stuff

1396
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.660
in general

1397
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.180
every problem

1398
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.820
might have a few

1399
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.420
different solutions

1400
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.260
so you'll need to

1401
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.140
generally have a good

1402
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.720
understanding of

1403
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.380
different patterns

1404
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.000
and the trade-offs

1405
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.240
in terms of performance

1406
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:25.900
security

1407
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.940
robustness

1408
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.280
cost

1409
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.720
etc

1410
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.960
this way you could pick

1411
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.140
the most fitting approach

1412
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.620
for the specific problem at hand

1413
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.540
and we'll have some resources

1414
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.220
some great books

1415
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.760
that you can read

1416
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.540
if this is something

1417
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.320
you want to brush up on

1418
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.620
but I think data

1419
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.460
data storage

1420
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.040
database

1421
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.220
and designing with

1422
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.300
thinking about data first

1423
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.000
is a really good one

1424
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.860
what should we say there

1425
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.300
Luciano?

1426
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.180
Yeah I think that the main realization

1427
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.260
that I personally had

1428
00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.140
is that almost

1429
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.320
every single application

1430
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.400
or solution

1431
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.260
that I ever designed

1432
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.360
required to persist

1433
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:52.940
data

1434
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.800
in a way or another

1435
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.760
and of course

1436
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.400
there are lots of

1437
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.160
different trade-offs

1438
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.220
and lots of different

1439
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.180
ways you can do that

1440
00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.880
so the business needs

1441
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.360
might vary a lot

1442
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.800
and therefore

1443
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.560
you need to figure out

1444
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.880
okay

1445
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.220
how do I

1446
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.460
effectively

1447
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.820
make sure that

1448
00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.440
I'm satisfying

1449
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.180
those business needs

1450
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.760
like for instance

1451
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.660
sometimes the data

1452
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.600
needs to always be

1453
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.300
super accurate

1454
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:11.780
and fresh

1455
00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.940
so how do I design

1456
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.060
a data storage

1457
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.080
that can fulfill

1458
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.960
that particular need

1459
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.640
sometimes you need to deal

1460
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.900
with large volumes of data

1461
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.020
how can I design

1462
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.960
a system that scales

1463
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.600
to support those

1464
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.240
large volumes

1465
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.240
other times

1466
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.800
you need to keep

1467
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.040
the entire history

1468
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.580
of changes

1469
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.560
for a long period

1470
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:26.920
of time

1471
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.560
because maybe

1472
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.000
I don't know

1473
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.040
you need like an audit trail

1474
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.100
how can I implement

1475
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.080
that audit trail

1476
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.320
into my solution

1477
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.840
and I think one of the

1478
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.280
realizations that I had

1479
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.240
at some point in my career

1480
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.340
is that I always thought

1481
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.180
okay I need to find

1482
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.040
the perfect database

1483
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.900
that can solve

1484
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.560
all these problems

1485
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.860
then learn that database

1486
00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.660
really really well

1487
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.740
and then I can build anything

1488
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.360
but the reality is of course

1489
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.800
more complex than that

1490
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.980
because there isn't really

1491
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.080
one solution that fits

1492
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.760
them all

1493
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.320
so you really need to understand

1494
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.080
what are the different

1495
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.000
solutions in the market

1496
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.220
what are they good at

1497
00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.140
and then based on

1498
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.000
your requirements

1499
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.180
very often you need

1500
00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.420
to combine multiple solutions

1501
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.920
to try to get the best

1502
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.620
of the different trade-offs

1503
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:02.900
right

1504
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.300
which can bring

1505
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.980
other complexity

1506
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.220
because sometimes

1507
00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:06.680
when you have

1508
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.740
multiple data storages

1509
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.980
you might have a problem

1510
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.380
of how do I synchronize

1511
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:10.720
the data

1512
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.680
if I need to synchronize

1513
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.840
it across multiple systems

1514
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.740
or maybe you need

1515
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.080
to query multiple data sources

1516
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.740
to come up with a view

1517
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.440
that makes sense

1518
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.100
in your application

1519
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.340
so all this stuff

1520
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.660
is something

1521
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.300
that you will learn

1522
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.860
with experience

1523
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.680
but the point is

1524
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.760
try to think about

1525
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.840
again what is it

1526
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.700
that you're trying to solve

1527
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.840
what are the business requirements

1528
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.740
and what tools

1529
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.220
are available

1530
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.980
that can help you

1531
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.040
probably you need

1532
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.880
a combination of

1533
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.360
these tools

1534
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.520
for the specific use case

1535
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.560
I'm not going to bore you

1536
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.260
with the CAP theorem

1537
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.800
but it's another thing

1538
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.760
that is probably worth

1539
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.060
understanding and exploring

1540
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060
and it's the idea

1541
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.240
that by design

1542
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.780
distributed storage system

1543
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.640
distributed databases

1544
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.660
cannot have

1545
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.460
all the qualities

1546
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.100
that you might expect

1547
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.740
from databases

1548
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.820
you can only pick

1549
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.680
two out of three

1550
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.700
between consistency

1551
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.060
availability

1552
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.040
and partition tolerance

1553
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.180
and that's why

1554
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.020
there are very different

1555
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.020
classes of databases

1556
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.040
with different characteristics

1557
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.900
so you can pick

1558
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.600
whichever one

1559
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.460
makes the most sense

1560
00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.520
for your use case

1561
00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.740
and your data storage needs

1562
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.040
there is a very good book

1563
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:01.380
called

1564
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.080
Designing Data Intensive Applications

1565
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.700
by Martin Kleppman

1566
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.940
it's the very famous

1567
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.420
red book

1568
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.040
with the boar

1569
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.720
on the cover

1570
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.100
so chances are

1571
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.080
you have seen that online

1572
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.760
I think that's

1573
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.480
a very good read

1574
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.120
if you want to

1575
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.680
kind of broaden

1576
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.240
your mind

1577
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.120
into thinking

1578
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.060
about storing data

1579
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.700
and all the different

1580
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.140
requirements

1581
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.600
you might have to deal with.

1582
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.660
Something

1583
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.420
that becomes more

1584
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.980
and more important

1585
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.060
for architects

1586
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.920
and when you've got

1587
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.140
to think about distributed data

1588
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.120
distributed systems

1589
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.900
you have to think

1590
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.500
about networks

1591
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.180
because that's how

1592
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.920
you distribute things

1593
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.500
and an understanding

1594
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:29.960
of networking

1595
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.380
is an important thing

1596
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.360
to have in your toolbox

1597
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.720
you should really understand

1598
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.520
like IP addressing

1599
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.060
and subnetting

1600
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.160
the basics of networking

1601
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.120
the OSI stack

1602
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.240
TCP IP

1603
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.300
to some degree

1604
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.720
DNS

1605
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.580
and of course

1606
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.000
HTTP

1607
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.980
which is ubiquitous

1608
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.960
personal litmus test

1609
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.280
there is

1610
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.020
could you explain

1611
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.940
everything that happens

1612
00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.800
this is a classic

1613
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.320
interview question

1614
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.180
could you explain

1615
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:53.940
everything that happens

1616
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.720
when you run a query

1617
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.160
on Google

1618
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.120
and hit enter

1619
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.940
in your browser

1620
00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.420
or enter URL

1621
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.220
into the URL bar

1622
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.880
can you describe

1623
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.460
all of the steps

1624
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:01.920
that happens

1625
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.500
and all the different

1626
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.320
network layers

1627
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.660
and protocols

1628
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.620
that result in

1629
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.720
a search result

1630
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.520
coming back for you

1631
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.900
and we'll have

1632
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.140
a pretty good guide

1633
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.620
from AWS

1634
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.320
in the show notes

1635
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.660
for networking essentials

1636
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.440
now

1637
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.420
you've mentioned

1638
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.360
operating systems

1639
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.900
as an important tool

1640
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.940
is that still the case

1641
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.740
even with all these

1642
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.440
layers of abstraction

1643
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:20.900
Luciano?

1644
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.280
Yeah you might make the point

1645
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.860
that it's becoming

1646
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.980
less and less important

1647
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.960
because of course

1648
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.860
there are more and more

1649
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.320
abstraction

1650
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.800
like function as a service

1651
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.620
will abstract

1652
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.540
most of what

1653
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.440
you need to know

1654
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.000
generally about

1655
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.760
the operating system

1656
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.660
but I still think

1657
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.200
that there is

1658
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.480
a very strong reason

1659
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.660
why you should understand

1660
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.480
at least the basics

1661
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.200
because I think

1662
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.460
you're never going to get rid

1663
00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.680
of things like

1664
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.700
I don't know

1665
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.640
even just understanding

1666
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.300
how does a process start

1667
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.120
this is still something

1668
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.980
you need to understand

1669
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.940
even with something

1670
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.540
like Lambda

1671
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.120
because in some cases

1672
00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.160
it will actually

1673
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.340
help you to troubleshoot

1674
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.520
why Lambda is not working

1675
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.660
or maybe to achieve

1676
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.440
certain things

1677
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.140
with your Lambda

1678
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.980
or another trivial example

1679
00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.100
is do you understand

1680
00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.620
the difference

1681
00:30:59.620 --> 00:30:59.980
for instance

1682
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.700
between memory

1683
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.200
and storage

1684
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.260
and the different trade-offs

1685
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.120
that can happen there

1686
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.000
you might end up

1687
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.620
writing a Lambda

1688
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.760
that requires a lot

1689
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.240
of memory

1690
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.140
just because maybe

1691
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.820
you are not really

1692
00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.880
paying attention

1693
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.560
to the design

1694
00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.360
of that particular piece

1695
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.800
of software

1696
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.900
and then maybe

1697
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.520
it just crashes

1698
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.080
at runtime

1699
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.960
and you don't know why

1700
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.020
so I think

1701
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.880
those are still things

1702
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.240
that you should have

1703
00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.620
some basic understanding of

1704
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.180
maybe you don't need

1705
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.560
to become an expert

1706
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.180
in Linux

1707
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.100
or operating system

1708
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.580
in general

1709
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580
but you should know

1710
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.340
all of this stuff

1711
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.160
another thing

1712
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.260
that is also relevant

1713
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.320
in this space

1714
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.060
is Docker

1715
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:28.900
or containers

1716
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.820
in general terms

1717
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.440
because that's

1718
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.580
another very common way

1719
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.300
to ship software

1720
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:33.820
in the cloud

1721
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.840
you might be using

1722
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.180
something like Fargate

1723
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.500
which abstracts

1724
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.400
the container workloads

1725
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.160
a little bit

1726
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.880
but you still need

1727
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.920
to know quite a lot

1728
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.600
about for instance

1729
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.460
how Docker works

1730
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.380
how to create

1731
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.960
a container

1732
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.980
how to provision

1733
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.020
and run container

1734
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.820
how to give it

1735
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.820
memory permissions

1736
00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.380
and so on

1737
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.460
and even more so

1738
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.160
if you end up

1739
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.980
designing for something

1740
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.560
like Kubernetes

1741
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.440
I think in that case

1742
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.900
you need to know

1743
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.920
even more about

1744
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.400
containers

1745
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.620
and operating systems

1746
00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.440
there are actually

1747
00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.300
two resources

1748
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.180
that I want to suggest

1749
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.760
one is the Docker curriculum

1750
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.820
which is a free resource

1751
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.700
that you can find

1752
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.080
I think it's part

1753
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.680
of the Docker

1754
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.940
official documentation

1755
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.560
we'll have a link

1756
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.140
in the show notes

1757
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.680
and that gives

1758
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.580
a very good

1759
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.680
and in-depth overview

1760
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.740
of how Docker works

1761
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.680
and how you can

1762
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.580
practically use it

1763
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.420
to build applications

1764
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.540
and then there is

1765
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.700
a book that I happened

1766
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.580
to read some time ago

1767
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.140
which is actually

1768
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.860
quite nice

1769
00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.400
and it's called

1770
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.360
How Linux Works

1771
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.160
by Brian Ward

1772
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.960
again we'll have

1773
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.920
the link in the show notes

1774
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.100
okay well two other quick

1775
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.940
things quickly then

1776
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.880
on the hard skills side

1777
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880
are of course

1778
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.240
programming

1779
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.020
we mentioned it

1780
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.960
a lot of architects

1781
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.780
don't get the opportunity

1782
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.700
to or don't feel

1783
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.260
they have to

1784
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.000
develop software

1785
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.860
we think you should

1786
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.700
try to do as much

1787
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.420
as you can

1788
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.260
obviously that's just

1789
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.740
our take

1790
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.600
for our context

1791
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.500
isn't the same

1792
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.440
in all companies

1793
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.220
you don't have to

1794
00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.040
take our word for it

1795
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.680
but the more

1796
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.500
hands-on experience

1797
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:41.920
you have

1798
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.580
the more you'll be

1799
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.320
able to relate to

1800
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:43.840
and communicate

1801
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.180
with other members

1802
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:45.700
of the team

1803
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.580
we'll have some links

1804
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.340
to help you with that

1805
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.280
and then security

1806
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.400
I think is something

1807
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.100
that's unavoidable

1808
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.180
as a skill for an architect

1809
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.540
it's becoming

1810
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.000
the number one

1811
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.720
toolkit

1812
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.060
tool in the toolkit

1813
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:57.920
really is understanding

1814
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.160
security threat modelling

1815
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.100
you don't have to be

1816
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:00.460
the expert

1817
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.140
but you do have to

1818
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.500
understand who to ask

1819
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.080
where to look

1820
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.900
and when to consider

1821
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.500
security

1822
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.520
so given those

1823
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.180
two hard skills

1824
00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:06.720
should we talk

1825
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.160
very quickly

1826
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160
about soft skills

1827
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:08.580
Luciano?

1828
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.900
Absolutely and we already

1829
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.700
mentioned that

1830
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.460
this is becoming

1831
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.380
more and more

1832
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:12.900
of a

1833
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.900
something that

1834
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.160
it's being acknowledged

1835
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:15.860
in the industry

1836
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.000
that you need

1837
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.880
to have soft skills

1838
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.780
you need to be able

1839
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.640
to communicate well

1840
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.580
to be successful

1841
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.600
in this kind of careers

1842
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.680
I think it's true

1843
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.660
for every type

1844
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.520
of technical career

1845
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.200
but of course

1846
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.800
when you are aiming

1847
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.460
to be an architect

1848
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.380
you are more exposed

1849
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.020
to be forward facing

1850
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.600
and talking with

1851
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.240
different people

1852
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.160
both technical

1853
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:31.860
and non-technical

1854
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.460
so of course

1855
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.960
you need to have

1856
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.400
those skills

1857
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.320
I was actually

1858
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:34.860
very surprised

1859
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.500
while I was looking

1860
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.280
online to prepare

1861
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:36.700
the notes

1862
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.400
for this episode

1863
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.200
I discovered

1864
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.600
that there is

1865
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.180
a university

1866
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.620
I'm not going

1867
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.160
to make the name

1868
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.520
just because

1869
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.000
we don't want

1870
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.500
to necessarily

1871
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:41.920
advertise

1872
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.240
that is a

1873
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.120
technical university

1874
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.700
like a software

1875
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.480
engineering university

1876
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.760
and they have

1877
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.580
an entire course

1878
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.440
on soft skills

1879
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.560
and they try

1880
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.280
to cover things

1881
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.300
like communication

1882
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:50.760
in terms of

1883
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.440
active listening

1884
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.000
and clarity

1885
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.960
collaboration

1886
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.640
in cross-functional

1887
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.220
teams

1888
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.620
self-awareness

1889
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.320
self-regulation

1890
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:57.860
empathy

1891
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.420
and relationship

1892
00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.920
management

1893
00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.500
I was really

1894
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.120
surprised to see

1895
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:00.900
all this topic

1896
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.920
being so explicitly

1897
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.740
covered in a

1898
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.220
technology

1899
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.160
type of degree

1900
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.280
so this is great

1901
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:05.640
to see

1902
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.180
and I think

1903
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:06.880
we should be

1904
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.520
putting more

1905
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.220
attention to

1906
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.920
these topics

1907
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.760
even inside

1908
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.160
companies

1909
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.920
we should encourage

1910
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.680
people to talk

1911
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.100
more about

1912
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:12.560
these kind of

1913
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:12.840
things

1914
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.700
and to have

1915
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.620
ways to help

1916
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.420
people develop

1917
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:15.920
these skills

1918
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.460
because I think

1919
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.040
everyone is going

1920
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.880
to benefit from that

1921
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.500
there are a few

1922
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.200
interesting books

1923
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:19.700
that I think

1924
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.540
are relevant here

1925
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.040
we'll have the

1926
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.640
links in the

1927
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.080
show notes

1928
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.940
for you to

1929
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.460
check them out

1930
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:23.800
later

1931
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.440
so I think

1932
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:24.840
we are getting

1933
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.480
close to the end

1934
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.340
so how do we

1935
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.380
give people a little

1936
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.180
bit more guidance

1937
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:28.960
to put things

1938
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.660
into practice

1939
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:30.760
well there's a lot of theory

1940
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.700
but in order

1941
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.780
to try and

1942
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.040
think about

1943
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.520
putting it into

1944
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:34.840
practice

1945
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.380
we would recommend

1946
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.280
you try learning

1947
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.920
in small increments

1948
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.460
and try to do

1949
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:38.940
some practice

1950
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.880
to consolidate

1951
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.740
every topic

1952
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.100
you learn

1953
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.160
we had an episode

1954
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:42.940
episode 58

1955
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.580
where we gave

1956
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.820
just some examples

1957
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.500
of project ideas

1958
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.020
to explore

1959
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.020
and concepts

1960
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.500
in the space

1961
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.220
of web application

1962
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:48.660
development

1963
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.260
machine learning

1964
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.820
and data science

1965
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.580
but if you're

1966
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.200
already working

1967
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:51.620
in the industry

1968
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.260
in other roles

1969
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.160
I would try

1970
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:53.660
and actively

1971
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.120
seek out

1972
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.540
opportunities

1973
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.280
to work more

1974
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.800
closely with

1975
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.240
architects

1976
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.000
in your company

1977
00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.720
and learn from them I'm going to give

1978
00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.840
you a quick list

1979
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.240
of things

1980
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.840
you can do

1981
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.780
that are a little

1982
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.460
bit more practical

1983
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:02.920
and again

1984
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.960
feel free to try

1985
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.420
other things

1986
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.880
this is just

1987
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.060
one potential path

1988
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.000
you'll need to learn

1989
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.820
core concepts

1990
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.480
system architecture

1991
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.060
databases

1992
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.620
networking

1993
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.220
security

1994
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:10.740
and so on

1995
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.980
I would suggest

1996
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.700
try to find

1997
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.820
courses online

1998
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.280
for instance

1999
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.180
a cloud guru

2000
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:15.600
udemy

2001
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.120
coursera

2002
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.540
whatever

2003
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.280
that the web

2004
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.760
is plenty

2005
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.400
of resources

2006
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.560
or books

2007
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.360
or whatever

2008
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.040
resource works

2009
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.340
for you

2010
00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.340
but try to be

2011
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:22.840
methodical

2012
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.400
and spend

2013
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:23.980
two weeks

2014
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.960
for every one

2015
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.520
of these topics

2016
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.160
and then maybe

2017
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.680
come back

2018
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.200
on rotation

2019
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:27.900
to learn more

2020
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.100
don't just try

2021
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.460
to focus

2022
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.240
on one topic

2023
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:30.900
for a long time

2024
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.380
because of course

2025
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:31.880
that topic

2026
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.740
can be endless

2027
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.480
and you don't

2028
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:33.880
want to find

2029
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.860
yourself in a rabbit hole

2030
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.420
where you're not

2031
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:35.900
progressing

2032
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.480
and building

2033
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.460
that more holistic

2034
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.620
view of these

2035
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.560
foundational topics

2036
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.320
in terms of

2037
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.080
programming skills

2038
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.320
there is plenty

2039
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:42.840
of resources

2040
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.460
we'll have some

2041
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.460
in the show notes

2042
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.000
that can help

2043
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.480
you to practice

2044
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.260
I would say

2045
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.900
try to do

2046
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.540
a few coding

2047
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.400
challenges per week

2048
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.260
even just one

2049
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.160
but at least get

2050
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.980
into the habit

2051
00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.580
of doing it

2052
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.200
recurringly

2053
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.000
especially if coding

2054
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.520
is not something

2055
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.180
that you get to do

2056
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.060
a lot in your

2057
00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.580
daily job

2058
00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.420
try to build

2059
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.900
that habit

2060
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.500
so that you have

2061
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.020
the confidence

2062
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.540
and you learn

2063
00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:58.960
to think

2064
00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.840
in terms of

2065
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.820
solving problems

2066
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.320
with code

2067
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.220
for AWS

2068
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.380
there is a lot

2069
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:03.980
to learn there

2070
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.060
and you might

2071
00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.980
decide to take

2072
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.580
a certification

2073
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.180
to have a more

2074
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:07.740
guided path

2075
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.660
or just try to

2076
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.840
explore the

2077
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.540
different services

2078
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.280
one by one

2079
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.540
again the goal

2080
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.320
is not to become

2081
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:13.700
an expert

2082
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.000
in every single

2083
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.360
service

2084
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:15.840
but just to

2085
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.400
explore a little

2086
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:16.980
bit the surface

2087
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:17.480
and understand

2088
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.080
the use cases

2089
00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.260
so the same

2090
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.100
suggestion applies

2091
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.920
try to invest

2092
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.980
a limited amount

2093
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.340
of time

2094
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:22.960
maybe a week

2095
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.760
on a few

2096
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.140
fundamental services

2097
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.940
one at a time

2098
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.680
maybe you start

2099
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.160
with EC2

2100
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.580
for instance

2101
00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.040
for a week

2102
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.500
then you try

2103
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.360
S3 for another

2104
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.660
week

2105
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.240
then you try

2106
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:30.860
something else

2107
00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.900
for another week

2108
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.040
I think at some

2109
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.700
point you will realize

2110
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.300
that there are some

2111
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.060
services that are

2112
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.780
more fundamental

2113
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.380
than others

2114
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.160
at least that was

2115
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:37.740
for me the case

2116
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.080
for instance

2117
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.700
with IAM

2118
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.540
everything I was

2119
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.160
doing I needed

2120
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.040
to deal with IAM

2121
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.880
and then at that

2122
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.560
point I think it

2123
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.520
makes sense to spend

2124
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.120
a little bit more

2125
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.640
time on those

2126
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.020
services

2127
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.640
deep dive

2128
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.520
and really understand

2129
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.500
how they work

2130
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.060
and how they can

2131
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.580
be integrated

2132
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.240
with the others

2133
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.280
finally I would say

2134
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.120
build a portfolio

2135
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.980
if you are building

2136
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.740
stuff why not

2137
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.460
just publishing it

2138
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:53.840
for instance

2139
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.220
on GitHub

2140
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.920
or maybe write

2141
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.360
an article

2142
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:55.980
that describes

2143
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.700
your experience

2144
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.800
all of that stuff

2145
00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.580
is going to

2146
00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.600
solve two purposes

2147
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.280
one is going to

2148
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:00.600
help you to

2149
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.220
consolidate your

2150
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.580
ideas

2151
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.500
but also if you

2152
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:02.940
ever need to

2153
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:03.620
showcase what

2154
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.020
you built

2155
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.720
you already have

2156
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.060
it there

2157
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.760
and it's nicely

2158
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.280
polished

2159
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.700
and you can

2160
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.160
talk through

2161
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.980
about that

2162
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.460
with people

2163
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.260
this is great

2164
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:09.800
if you are

2165
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.620
maybe you want

2166
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:10.980
to start to

2167
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.140
work

2168
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.140
you want to

2169
00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:12.580
start a solo

2170
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.360
career as a

2171
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:13.740
consultant

2172
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.280
you can use

2173
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.740
that as a

2174
00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.100
way to

2175
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.400
showcase

2176
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.000
your potential

2177
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.560
customers

2178
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.340
that you know

2179
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.780
your stuff

2180
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.540
or maybe if

2181
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:18.840
you are just

2182
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.300
trying to get

2183
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:19.900
hired into a

2184
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.220
company

2185
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.020
so you can bring

2186
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:21.700
into an interview

2187
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.280
to prove that

2188
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.140
you learned

2189
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.860
something useful

2190
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.440
for the job

2191
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.040
and finally

2192
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.760
networking and

2193
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.340
community will

2194
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.060
go a long way

2195
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.000
thankfully in the

2196
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.760
AWS space

2197
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.540
there is a lot

2198
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.280
of activity going

2199
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:31.540
on

2200
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.380
there are AWS

2201
00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.060
user groups

2202
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.240
both online

2203
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.800
and physically

2204
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.020
there is a

2205
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.640
web page

2206
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.320
published on

2207
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.300
AWS with

2208
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.380
almost 600

2209
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.040
user groups

2210
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.060
so most likely

2211
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.520
there will be

2212
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.140
one close to

2213
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.680
you and if

2214
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.120
not you can

2215
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:43.680
probably join

2216
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.280
some of the

2217
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.920
remote ones

2218
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.660
so we'll have

2219
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.200
a link in

2220
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.720
the show notes

2221
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.660
okay and that

2222
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.200
brings us to

2223
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:48.800
the end of

2224
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.420
this episode

2225
00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.800
and I will

2226
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.080
say that

2227
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.500
becoming a

2228
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:51.980
cloud architect

2229
00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.560
is definitely

2230
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.420
not a get

2231
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:53.920
reach quick

2232
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.260
scheme

2233
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.120
it's more

2234
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.700
like an

2235
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.380
ongoing adventure

2236
00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.260
you need to

2237
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.260
be patient

2238
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:58.580
and keep

2239
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:58.880
learning

2240
00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.220
growing

2241
00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.920
and constantly

2242
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.600
adapting to

2243
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.180
new changes

2244
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.400
so of course

2245
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.780
it's something

2246
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.700
that you should

2247
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.280
start today

2248
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.200
but you probably

2249
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:05.900
never stop

2250
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.800
and that's

2251
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.520
actually the

2252
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.200
thing that we

2253
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:08.940
personally love

2254
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.740
we have been

2255
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.500
doing this

2256
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.140
job for a

2257
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.880
while but we

2258
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.380
still feel

2259
00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.240
we haven't

2260
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:13.840
reached the

2261
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.240
point where

2262
00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.800
we could say

2263
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.260
oh we are

2264
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:15.680
the perfect

2265
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.220
cloud architect

2266
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.780
we are still

2267
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.240
learning every

2268
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:17.480
day

2269
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.260
there is a

2270
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:18.700
lot that we

2271
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.020
don't know

2272
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.400
there is a

2273
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.800
lot of

2274
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.680
experimenting

2275
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.120
and trying

2276
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.400
to figure

2277
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:21.760
out what's

2278
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.080
the best

2279
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.460
solution

2280
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:22.980
and I

2281
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.360
think that's

2282
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:23.820
probably the

2283
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.380
best part

2284
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:24.880
of this

2285
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.400
role that

2286
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:25.980
you are

2287
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.000
always working

2288
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.460
with people

2289
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:27.920
and trying to

2290
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.460
solve problems

2291
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.500
together and

2292
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.180
every time you

2293
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:30.640
get a little

2294
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.380
bit better at

2295
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.460
it so we

2296
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:32.780
hope this

2297
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.180
episode has

2298
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.620
been useful

2299
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.240
and we look

2300
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:34.700
forward to

2301
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.280
hearing about

2302
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.820
your journey

2303
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.300
as a cloud

2304
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:36.920
architect so

2305
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.500
don't be shy

2306
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.000
and reach out

2307
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.440
to us and

2308
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:38.920
let us know

2309
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.320
how it is

2310
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.000
going how you

2311
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.500
are progressing

2312
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.080
and what are

2313
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.340
you thinking

2314
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:41.920
to do next

2315
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.720
so thank you

2316
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.120
so much for

2317
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.540
hanging out

2318
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:43.860
with us

2319
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.380
today and

2320
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:44.780
until next

2321
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.120
time

2322
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.940
happy cloud architecting.
