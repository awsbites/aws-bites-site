00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280
Hello and welcome to another episode of AWS Bites, the weekly show where we talk about

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.600
AWS and answer questions in around about five minutes.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.460
I'm Eoin and we're joined by Luciano again.

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.060
And before we get started, make sure you give us a follow and subscribe so you can be notified

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.940
when the next episode goes live.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.500
And today we've got a different kind of a question focused on something we didn't talk

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.760
about before, which is Amplify.

8
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.420
And the question is, what can you do with Amplify Studio?

9
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.680
So I think we maybe did touch on Amplify once or twice just in passing, maybe when we were

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.840
talking about static hosting and cloud formation versus console.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.680
But let's dive into Amplify Studio a little bit more because we had an announcement at

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.700
reInvent recently and it was about Amplify Studio.

13
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.160
But maybe it's best to start with a bit of a history of Amplify and what else Amplify

14
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
does.

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640
How would you describe it, AWS Amplify?

16
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.980
Yeah, Amplify is an interesting product because I think it's a little bit of a shift from AWS in many ways.

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.720
Like in general, in AWS, I feel that you have always like very low control and you have

18
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.560
to understand all the nitty gritty details.

19
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.140
So it has been like always a little bit of a challenge for many types of developers to

20
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.280
come and use AWS because they need to kind of approach everything at a very low level

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.080
and then build up from there.

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.240
So Amplify is a shift because they try to give you like an easier environment to build

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.380
applications.

24
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.880
And I have a feeling that they are targeting primarily front end developers because front

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.800
end has been really like the main thing that you still have to build on your own.

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
And they try to abstract everything else to make your life easier.

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.280
So that's why I feel that front end developers are the target users for this product.

28
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.240
And the idea, I suppose, is that AWS wants to give front end developers all the other

29
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.880
capabilities that they need to build a fully fledged application without having to know

30
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.760
things like CI-CD or I don't know, cloud formation or how to create user pools incognito

31
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.560
because all these things are nicely abstracted for you from Amplify.

32
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
Yeah.

33
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.800
And it's got a few different features, hasn't it?

34
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.440
Like there's a few different ways to get started with it.

35
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.880
So I know that there's an Amplify CLI and I think when it started, you had the Amplify

36
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.960
SDK and the CLI.

37
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.120
What other parts do you have?

38
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.640
Yeah.

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.920
Also you mentioned the CLI, you mentioned the SDK, so a client library that you can

40
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.160
use either in a mobile... because you can build mobile and web projects.

41
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.360
So you will have SDKs in both environments.

42
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.480
But other components are, for instance, an integration with your Git repository, whatever

43
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.800
that is, doesn't have to be necessarily in AWS.

44
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.480
And that will automatically create a CI-CD pipeline for you.

45
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.760
So you can basically get GitOps by default.

46
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760
Yeah.

47
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560
Very nice.

48
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.040
And the new thing that was announced recently is Amplify Studio, which is, I would say,

49
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.080
kind of a UI and more UI friendly environments where you can do many of these things in a

50
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.520
kind of more clicky, clicky way.

51
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.760
For instance, you can create data models by just clicking in a UI and defining all your

52
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.920
fields and you can select the constraints and relationship between maybe fields from

53
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.480
a table with fields in another table.

54
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.280
And then at the end, when you just click save, that is going to provision a DynamoDB table

55
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
for you.

56
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
It's going to provision GraphQL APIs to access this data.

57
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.040
So Amplify Studio is like, okay, I don't know anything about how to provision all these

58
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.220
different things, but I can easily explore these concepts and they are very friendly

59
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.960
for me to create things and deploy them.

60
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.800
Yeah, I can imagine with all of these things, if you're building them from scratch, like you said, AWS, you usually operate at a low level, it requires a lot of expertise.

61
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.760
And if you look at the feature list on Amplify and the level of abstraction it provides,

62
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.680
it's giving you authentication and data and file storage, serverless APIs with GraphQL

63
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.520
or just REST, and then it gives you messaging, analytics, push notifications, geolocation,

64
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.240
and even like ML features like predictions, predictive analytics, and AR and VR support,

65
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.440
which I don't know if I'd ever use it, but it's interesting that it's there.

66
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.880
Building all these things yourself.

67
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.900
And I think the reason they also announced like a storage abstraction, so probably you'll get more and more support for applications that require, I don't know, users to upload

68
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.800
files or to manage, I don't know, content for user that maybe you will start normally

69
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.100
in S3 without having to know all the nuances of S3 and uploads and all these things.

70
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.520
I'm just thinking about the amount of time I've spent building these things manually

71
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.640
from the, I suppose, raw AWS components.

72
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.680
And of course it's really useful to know how all these things fit together, but if you're

73
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.180
starting from scratch with AWS, I can imagine the lead time to getting all of these things

74
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.240
up and running and understanding them is going to be many, many months realistically.

75
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.680
So if Amplify lets you get started in hours to build this basic capability, I can certainly

76
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.160
see the attraction of that.

77
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.520
And so is there an AWS Amplify service?

78
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.240
So is it doing anything special that you can't do in those raw services?

79
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.920
I would probably say for the most part, no, meaning that at the end of the day, Amplify is managing a cloud formation stack for you.

80
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.680
So if you're really curious, you can just go in your cloud formation panel and see exactly

81
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.280
like what are all the resources that have been provisioned by your interactions with

82
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.760
Amplify either from the CLI or the Amplify studio.

83
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.600
So there is really no magic to it if you want, but it's still nice that you can get a lot

84
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.280
of things done very quickly.

85
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.280
Like if you will have to do all these things using infrastructure as code, probably it

86
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.280
will take you much longer to ship anything to production.

87
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.040
So I suppose it's more of a question of how much control do you want to have compared

88
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.880
to like, do you just want to build something simple and ship it quickly?

89
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880
So I don't know.

90
00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:03.800
What do you think in terms of maybe like what kind of use cases would you use it for?

91
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.720
Yeah, what kind of use cases?

92
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.920
This is a good question.

93
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:17.360
So if I look at the way it's built data models, authentication, storage as the fundamental

94
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.740
components you can imagine using for any kind of CRUD app where you want users to sign up

95
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.760
and log in and create something, you know, and that could be uploading images, filling

96
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.740
out forms, adding entries.

97
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.960
So basically CRUD apps and everything is kind of a CMS or a CRUD app at its core.

98
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.560
It feels like most applications are.

99
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.240
But if you don't have very, very complex business logic at the backend, I think it seems like

100
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.140
a reasonably good fit and you want to get started pretty quickly.

101
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.720
So I think there's a couple of questions with stuff like this.

102
00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.800
We've learned over time to be a little bit fearful of high level abstractions in case

103
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.520
they leak eventually or you're trying to move forward and ultimately you want to drop down

104
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:14.180
to the low level components and does it make it possible and is it a reversible process?

105
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.200
So can you get the best of both worlds?

106
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.400
Can you continue to use Amplify and keep customizing those components at the backend?

107
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.380
From what I've seen with Amplify, yes and no is the answer to that.

108
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.340
So you can add custom cloud formation, for example, which is nice.

109
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.760
You can incorporate existing CDK components.

110
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.760
That's a new enough feature.

111
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:44.620
And you can also eject or export the application to CDK and incorporate it into a CDK pipeline.

112
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:52.280
So it's interesting to watch it evolve because I was, as Amplify, the story has emerged.

113
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.760
I have been a bit skeptical, but I'm kind of surprised that it's keeping a good level

114
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.360
of quality there, adding a lot of useful features.

115
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.300
And they seem to be very serious about investing in it and supporting lots of different users

116
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.320
coming from lots of different frameworks, technologies, working on different types of

117
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320
applications.

118
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.780
So it's really trying to have a broad reach, which is ambitious, of course, but they're

119
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.560
clearly serious about it and it was a big feature of Werner Fochel's keynote at Reinvent.

120
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.920
So it kind of bodes well.

121
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.520
And on that topic then, there was at the keynote, Ali Spittel was on and talking about the Amplify

122
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.600
Studio, and I suppose that's what we're here to talk about.

123
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.760
So I know that last year we had Amplify admin UI, and now we've got Amplify Studio.

124
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.960
So what does Amplify Studio give you that we didn't have before?

125
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.920
Yeah, I think the most impressive thing that was added is the ability to easily collaborate with designers through Figma integrations.

126
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.320
Basically what you can do, I was playing with this a little bit yesterday, you could, as

127
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.400
part of your Amplify project, you could have Figma project.

128
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.300
You can, for instance, download a template that you get from AWS to easily get started,

129
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.640
but then you design all your components in Figma and you have a process that allows you

130
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.140
to synchronize those components back into Amplify as React components.

131
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.600
Of course, these React components are in a way immutable, like you are not supposed to

132
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.720
change the code because, again, if the designer changes some details, they will be resynchronized

133
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.140
so all your changes will be overridden, but I suppose you can wrap those components with

134
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.860
components that will provide all the additional business logic.

135
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.520
It is still a little bit limited, meaning there are things that are missing, like, I

136
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:57.840
don't know, pagination was one that wasn't obvious how you could build it or routing,

137
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.140
like it's not obviously described how would you build the routing.

138
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.980
In this, probably, again, you need to wrap the components with your own custom components.

139
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.640
So I think it's not perfect yet, but it's impressive to see, first of all, that there

140
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.660
is a collaboration at that level with something like Figma, which is a well recognized industry

141
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.660
tool.

142
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:24.560
So AWS rather than building their own UI designing tool, I guess, they decided to create this

143
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.160
collaboration and it's actually very smoothly integrated, like you don't have to do, I don't

144
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.940
know, weird permission screen or stuff like that.

145
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.920
It's very intuitively how you connect the two.

146
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.740
But yeah, it seems like there is still a long way to go to actually make it really powerful

147
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.900
so that you can build more complicated applications with that.

148
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.140
Yeah, it seems like you still need to know what you're doing and you need to know your way around a React app.

149
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.540
So it's still kind of aimed at front end developers and it's still React only, right?

150
00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:02.940
So even though Amplify supports lots of different front end frameworks, including Angular and

151
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:13.220
Vue and Ionic and as well mobile front ends, so it supports Flutter, you can do React Native.

152
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.380
So who is it aimed at then?

153
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:22.980
So what kind of users, is this something for everybody or is it aimed at, you seem to mention

154
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.580
people just getting started doing personal applications.

155
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.220
Does it have broader appeal?

156
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.740
Would you use it for an application that you expect to be around for five years?

157
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.100
Yeah, that's an interesting question.

158
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.580
I guess it depends on how standard I'm going to say is your application.

159
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.860
And by that, I mean, I don't know, is it just managing CRUD type of data?

160
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.460
So you can just define your entities and then you just need to have easy ways to, I don't

161
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.700
know, create, update, delete.

162
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.140
I think if that's your use case, probably you can get a long way with Amplify for the

163
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.540
features you get right now.

164
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:04.180
I can also see more sophisticated use cases where, I don't know, maybe you have data models

165
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.580
that are more dynamic or where you need to have, I don't know, integrations maybe with

166
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:16.980
external services where maybe Amplify, it will be, maybe you'll need to work around,

167
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.220
let's say the limitations of Amplify and maybe the solution is not going to come so easily.

168
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.460
Maybe we'll become more as a blocker than as an enabler in that case.

169
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.100
But definitely, I don't know, I can see it being very useful for either an MVP where

170
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.580
you just want to prototype something very, very quickly to see if it makes sense as a

171
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.140
business or if you're doing a small site project or a personal utility application where, I

172
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.140
mean, you are not opening it up to a big public.

173
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.940
You just need something that works for a specific need that you might have.

174
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.240
Probably Amplify is a big win because we'll give you a much faster time to actually use

175
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.940
in the product.

176
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.660
I am a little bit skeptical on enterprise type of applications, mainly because there

177
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.560
are some important missing features.

178
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:08.900
For instance, the ability to deploy into a private network, a private DPC or SAML authentication

179
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.500
is another thing that it wasn't obvious how to do it.

180
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.520
Maybe it is possible, but the default authentication system doesn't seem to provide an option for

181
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.520
that.

182
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.100
So maybe, again, something you could bend Amplify to be able to achieve, but it doesn't

183
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.980
seem easily supported.

184
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:38.460
Actually, this is an area where I think Amplify could really win if they added a few features like that because I can see lots of enterprises out there who are struggling to get the time

185
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:44.900
and the people to be able to build custom applications for line of business applications

186
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.980
or applications that integrate existing data sources.

187
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.980
I think if you have AD integration for authentication, internal hosting, like you say, and the ability

188
00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.440
to integrate into some existing APIs and integrate systems together in a lightweight way with

189
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.060
adding some of these features like storage and data behind them, I think you could end

190
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.820
up with something really powerful that would be adopted and gain a lot of popularity in

191
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.300
enterprise.

192
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.740
So while it might feel like something that's suitable for startups or for people building

193
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.180
the MVP of a SaaS application, I think that's actually where it could really shine in the

194
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.980
future if we get those kind of features.

195
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.140
Is there anything else that you can see in the future direction of Amplify then?

196
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.840
Because I guess I feel, as you alluded to, with these UI components that have recently

197
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.060
been announced, it's like giving you that automated front end capability in collaboration

198
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.060
with designers.

199
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.400
It kind of feels like it's just the start though.

200
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.260
You can't build a full UI application automatically with Amplify yet.

201
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.380
Is that where it's going?

202
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.960
I would expect this to be definitely one of the next milestones for the Amplify team to

203
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:04.820
allow designers and developers to work together even more closely by defining not just the

204
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.120
shape of the components, but also how the components come together and the interactions

205
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.300
between the components.

206
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:17.180
So again, navigation, signup, pagination, all these kind of things, I think they will

207
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.420
come in the next releases.

208
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.580
But also we probably mentioned that already, right now you can only integrate with the

209
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.680
data models that you define in Amplify or at least in an easy way.

210
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:38.220
I think it might make sense for Amplify to also show easy way to also integrate with

211
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.300
data sources that are not in your Amplify project.

212
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:47.060
For instance, other APIs that maybe exist in your enterprise or other external APIs

213
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.140
or even things that are not classically exposed to a REST or a GraphQL API.

214
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.980
Maybe you just want to interact with, I don't know, even a SOAP system.

215
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.980
Right?

216
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.980
Yeah, exactly.

217
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.380
So in an enterprise, I can definitely see that still happening a lot.

218
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.100
Some random FTP servers.

219
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.220
It might be nice to have that too.

220
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:12.260
So yeah, those things will make it Amplify closer, I suppose, to a low code type of solution.

221
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.780
Yeah.

222
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.380
That's really interesting.

223
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.460
I think this is, we're probably getting to the end of our time here and going a little

224
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.460
over as usual, but I think one of the things that I feel about this is that from your perspective

225
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.600
and my perspective, we're looking at Amplify from our existing bias of understanding how

226
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600
to use CloudFormation.

227
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.580
We've got a comfort level with AWS that just comes from using it over the course of many

228
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:43.100
years, but we're probably not the primary target audience for Amplify.

229
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.320
So really interested to know what other people are doing with it.

230
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.860
So this is one where user feedback and listener feedback is really going to help us to shape

231
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.140
how we talk about this kind of thing in future.

232
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.740
So if people have used Amplify either to build applications from scratch or to augment existing

233
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.300
applications, maybe you're doing something really interesting and quirky with Amplify,

234
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:11.780
we'd love you to give us a message on Twitter or in the comments on YouTube and let us know

235
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.860
what you think.

236
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.100
And we'd really like to follow up on it.

237
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.860
It doesn't have to be, we don't have to cover it all in this episode.

238
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:25.180
So please, and also please share it if you know other people using Amplify, share links

239
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.880
to the podcast and make sure to follow and subscribe because we'll come back to this

240
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.300
in the future I feel because I feel like there's definitely a lot more to happen.

241
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.300
Okay, so let's wrap it up.

242
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.260
Thanks very much for listening everybody.

243
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.740
And we'll talk to you on the next episode of AWS.

244
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740
Bye.

245
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.740
Bye.

246
00:18:41.740 --> 00:19:04.780
schemes.
