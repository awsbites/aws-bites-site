00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.940
Hello and welcome to AWS Bites, the weekly show where we answer your questions about

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.160
AWS. I am Luciano and today I'm joined by Eoin. And before we get started, please let

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.100
me remind you to please follow and subscribe this channel so you can be up to date every

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.980
time we publish new episodes. And today's question is actually somewhat relevant to

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.380
this because we want to try and answer the question, how do you keep up with AWS in 2022?

6
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.040
The new year is just around the corner. So what are the best resources out there for

7
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.920
you to know about all the news about AWS every time there is something worth knowing about?

8
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.440
Eoin, do you want to try to start to give an answer to this question?

9
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.700
Yeah, I guess we have to start off saying that everybody should keep listening to AWS and keep subscribing and listen to all the episodes because everything that we think

10
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.040
is relevant and interesting to talk about will be having at least weekly episodes throughout

11
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.040
2022. There's so many resources out there. The question is how do you filter out and

12
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.760
pick something? And I guess my habits change quite regularly and I dip in and out of various

13
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.280
different pieces of content and it depends on my mood and what I'm doing and how much

14
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.160
time I have. And sometimes I don't keep up to date for periods of time. And I guess that's

15
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.040
the same for everybody. There are some people who are going to be obsessively keeping up

16
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.720
to date and following RSS streams, RSS feeds of news announcements. That's not really how

17
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.100
I like to do it. I suppose my strategy is kind of best effort, but also trying to keep

18
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.040
a passive awareness of what's happening in the world of AWS in the background. And there's

19
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.640
a couple of fairly fundamental AWS update resources I use just to kind of keep that

20
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.400
passive awareness going. And one is the AWS official podcast. And sometimes I just listen

21
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.760
to that when I'm traveling or have headphones in and I have a bit of time and they basically

22
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.480
just read out all the announcements on that podcast. And so it's not particularly thrilling

23
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.160
or opinionated, but it covers absolutely everything. So if you want to know what easy to instance

24
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.800
types there are, or what new languages are available for Lex, then it will tell you everything

25
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.640
in great detail. And it's kind of something that doesn't sink in too deep, but it's there

26
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.820
in the back of your mind. So if you encounter it in the future, you might think about it.

27
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.440
And another thing that's really useful for that is there's a Twitter feed. It's Twitter

28
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.580
bot, not official, but it's called What's New on AWS. And I think it basically just

29
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.520
tweets out all the announcements that come on the AWS official blogs. And you end up

30
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.280
getting a few notifications per day. If you tick the bell on Twitter, then you get a few

31
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.020
notifications every day and most of them will be pretty irrelevant to you and you can just

32
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.000
ignore them instantly, but others are interesting and then you can dig deeper and read about

33
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.980
them. So I find that really efficient way of keeping up to date. So those are pretty

34
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.080
boring ones, but very useful.

35
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.000
Yeah.

36
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.200
I suppose on the last one, if you are more of a feed reader type of person, you can just subscribe to the feed reader from the official AWS announcement blog and you'll

37
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.400
get the same type of content from the Twitter post. So yeah, it's interesting that we have

38
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.240
these days a huge variety of medias where you can consume information from. I don't

39
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.200
know, another option could be YouTube channels. There is no shortage of YouTube channels related

40
00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:03.520
to AWS and definitely a few shout outs to Marcia Villalba, FUBAR. It's a really good

41
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.320
one. And I know that Marcia is also doing content in Spanish, so that could be also

42
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.200
interesting. Could be another way to access this information if you prefer content in

43
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.800
another language. There is again, no shortage of material out there. So that's another one

44
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.400
that is definitely recommended. I'm always flipping between, I suppose, more YouTube

45
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.360
videos and classic, more traditional blog posts or written articles. And I want to give

46
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.720
another shout out to Borislav Atziv. I hope I am pronouncing it right. I ended up reading

47
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.280
a lot of his CDK blog posts. They are very good, very in detail, and generally you find

48
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.880
very complete examples. So that was a very specific quest for me at the beginning of

49
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.920
last year to start learning more and more about CDK. So I ended up in this blog post

50
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.480
and then started to read the next one and the next one and the next one and there is

51
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.700
a lot of good material out there. It's very niche. I think it's mostly CDK, but if that's

52
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.080
something you want to learn more about, definitely I recommend that particular blog. And by the

53
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.320
way, you'll find all the links in the description of this episode. And yeah, let's see. Another

54
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.920
one that I really like in terms of blog, and it's a little bit different, I guess, from

55
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:39.760
most blogs is Werner Vogel's own blog post, because there is a huge effort in publishing

56
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.140
regularly, I would say, but there are some blog posts that are actually very deep and

57
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.480
you get a lot of principles and ideas about how to architect distributed systems, which

58
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.040
is not always strictly related to AWS, but of course, it's some knowledge that you need

59
00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.240
to have and you need to keep building if you want to use AWS efficiently. And with that,

60
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.800
of course, there are mixed blog posts where the focus is more maybe on a new service of

61
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.100
AWS. So you can definitely also find that kind of, okay, what's new on AWS type of material.

62
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.760
So I think it's an interesting combination of strictly related AWS topics, but also things

63
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.680
that you might need to know in terms of how to architect good distributed systems. Yeah.

64
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.720
Anything else on your radar? Yeah.

65
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.720
There's a couple, I suppose, the first few things we mentioned that were about just keeping up to date with news announcements.

66
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.900
We're getting into more like, how do you keep up to date with community and best practices

67
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.880
and how to's and there's so much there. There's one set of resources I've been using quite

68
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.560
a lot, which is the CloudAnnot blog and YouTube channel. And this is from Andreas and Michael

69
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.440
Wittig, who are brothers who have an AWS consultancy. And the one thing that stands out about this

70
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.840
content to me is that if you're looking for knowledge, as opposed to just discussion and

71
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.360
opinions, these videos and blog posts are just really well crafted and very well thought

72
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.920
out and informative. So they're always, I think, done in such a way that you have the

73
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.660
video and the accompanying blog posts. So you've got both formats and they're just really

74
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.120
well done. So if you're looking for how to set up SSO, for example, for the first time,

75
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.340
or basic stuff around IAM or how to do code pipeline and code build, they've quite a lot

76
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.240
of blogs that are just really informative and really well thought out. And I think they

77
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.920
stand out as being different because they're just really knowledge rich and well structured

78
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.000
and they're not so opinion based.

79
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
They look like tutorials, right?

80
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.920
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And they're just really well written and you always leave with a sense

81
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.200
that you have a much more complete understanding than you started with.

82
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.640
Yeah. And I also like that they have this kind of double format video and text so you

83
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.560
can pick your favorite or even consume both as a second way of digesting the same type

84
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.280
of information.

85
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.760
Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah. And you were talking about Werner Fokkel's content.

86
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.400
That's quite, I suppose, like you say, deeper. The builders library in AWS is kind of similar

87
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.960
to that, isn't it? In that it's deeper architectural practices and organizational practices that

88
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.240
are, I suppose, require a little bit more study.

89
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.720
Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.040
There are a couple actually of interesting articles that were even mentioned by Werner Vogels at his latest re-invent keynote. And one is about the importance of constant

91
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:09.040
work. Another one is about how to design idempotent IPIs. And I think those two articles are actually

92
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.440
very good in giving you information that maybe you have been exposed to, but probably you

93
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.440
kind of underestimated. And it's good that they remark why these kind of concepts are

94
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:25.200
so important to build very good distributed systems. But also they are kind of representative

95
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.200
of the type of content you can find in this particular section of the AWS website. So

96
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.420
all the content is pretty much that in-depth focus on one specific architectural topic.

97
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.600
So if you are trying to become an architect or if you are already an architect and you

98
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.280
want to explore more in-depth topics, I think that that's really a good resource.

99
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:57.400
Yeah. Okay. That sounds good.

100
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.200
I mean, when I'm in kind of busy periods, I guess it gets very difficult trying to watch videos or read blog posts and getting the time to actually

101
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.080
sit down and focus. But podcasts can be pretty useful sometimes because you can have them

102
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.600
on in the background and you mightn't hear everything and you might be able to focus

103
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.920
on everything, but sometimes some of it just does stick and that could be useful and serve

104
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.920
you in the future. So do you have any go-to podcasts?

105
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.040
I actually want to mention two of them. One is probably the newest I've seen in this space

106
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:31.380
is Adam Elmore's AWS FM. And I really liked that one because it feels a little bit lighter

107
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.220
than at least many of the other types of content we have been mentioning because it's more

108
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:42.600
a conversation between people that are prominent in the AWS ecosystem. And it's more about,

109
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.800
I don't know, their life story, what they built, how did they get to the place where

110
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.520
they are today. And of course, you get to learn a lot of interesting information about

111
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.760
AWS, but it's more about the personal journey of the guests. So I think this is the kind

112
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.840
of podcast you can listen without necessarily being too focused on the content, but still

113
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.520
you can get a pretty good value for the time you spend listening to the podcast. So I really

114
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.840
liked that particular format. But there is another one that is a little

115
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.040
bit more technical, it's from Yan Cui, which is Real-World Serverless. And that one is

116
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.340
a lot more, well, first of all, it's focused on serverless, but it's more the story of

117
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.920
people that have built successful systems using serverless and what they learned. So

118
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.960
there is a lot more like serverless from the trenches or you get to hear, okay, this did

119
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.560
work, this did work. So that's a lot more practical and focused. So if you are interested

120
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:48.680
in serverless, that's really a great resource. Yeah.

121
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.240
And Yan Cui also has a bunch of really good blog posts on serverless that are, I suppose, indispensable for anybody in the

122
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.140
space. I really like those two podcasts too. I mean, and there's the serverless chats one

123
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:05.400
as well. I guess they all have different styles and approaches and it depends on the kind

124
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.000
of mood I'm in, which one I listen to. But I do really like that real world serverless

125
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.800
approach where you get people talking about the use cases and stuff they're really building

126
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:22.320
and ultimately what doesn't work, which is sometimes missing from a lot of other content.

127
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.400
Like what are the gotchas and the failure modes?

128
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280
Yeah, I think in a similar vein- Is there anybody?

129
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.440
Exactly. Yeah, because Twitter is another way to consume pretty much like random content,

130
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.560
right? But if you follow people then in a specific niche, then you get more focused

131
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.600
on that particular type of content. And there are in particular three profiles that I really

132
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.760
like. Emily Shea is probably one of the new profiles that I started to follow recently

133
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.000
and she has been producing a lot of amazing content, especially targeting people that

134
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.280
are starting with AWS. So if you are in that particular part of the journey, definitely

135
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.360
follow Emily. You'll get a lot of value for that. And then other two are evangelists in

136
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.040
AWS, Danilo Poce and 8OrLess. I think we mentioned them already in a previous episode. They are

137
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.840
always producing a huge amount of material and even just giving you information about

138
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.520
new services or things that you can now do in AWS that maybe you couldn't do before or

139
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:36.320
it was more complicated. So it's good also to get few bits of information by just following

140
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:45.160
their profiles. So definitely recommend it. Do you have any other profile you would recommend?

141
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.760
I guess, yeah, I just wanted to call out, since you mentioned Emily Shea, I think we

142
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.440
both managed to catch Emily's talk at Reinvent, which was a really, really excellent talk

143
00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.040
on serverless. And I think a lot of people who are using AWS, but thinking about getting

144
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.000
into serverless might be looking at that in the new year and how do you discover more

145
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.520
about serverless? And I think Emily's talk is a really good place to start. But another

146
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:16.880
one I wanted to mention, and I think we mentioned serverless chats and Jeremy Daily as well.

147
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.440
Jeremy's off by none newsletter is a really, really good resource. So it's a weekly newsletter

148
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.040
and because there's so much content out there, I think Jeremy puts a lot of time into distilling

149
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.640
it down into like, here's some articles that I'd like to highlight for you. And it just

150
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.800
makes it really efficient to keep up to date without having to do all the work. He's kind

151
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.320
of done all the effort for you. So I just wanted to shout that out. And he's on Twitter

152
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:49.280
as well. So we'll add his Twitter handle into the feed as well. But I think that's covered

153
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.240
everything I had anyway. I think there's plenty there for people. But I'd be interested if

154
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.280
what are we missing? Maybe people have some good suggestions out there.

155
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.040
Yeah, it would be great if you can just leave us a comment or a tweet saying, okay, I would recommend this particular resource for whatever reason you like it. I think that will help

156
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.480
us to give even more ideas and content to people following us. And also for us, maybe

157
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.760
we can discover resources that we didn't know about. So that would be amazing.

158
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.760
Yeah, maybe a good new year's resolution is to switch the people you follow and change the content you're consuming just to get out of the filter bubble and get some new perspectives

159
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.840
on everything AWS. Absolutely. Okay.

160
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.240
I think that's all we have for today. Thanks again for being with us and listening to this episode. Again, make

161
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:47.480
sure to follow and subscribe us. And yeah, again, if you have comments or opinions, please

162
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.800
share them. We'd love to hear. And if you have any question you would like us to answer,

163
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.440
definitely send it our way and we'll try our best in one of the next episodes. And that's

164
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:12.280
all. See you in the next episode.
