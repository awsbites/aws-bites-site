00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
Hello today we were going to answer the question should I get AWS certification

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.340
And we're going to cover why a certification can be important from the perspective of individuals and companies

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.620
What are the certifications available? We're going to give some suggestions for a study plan and various resources and tips

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:29.800
My name is Eoin and today I'm joined by Luciano and this is the AWS bytes podcast

5
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.520
The first question I think we can answer is is it worth it to get AWS certification?

6
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.980
Do you want to try and answer that Luciano?

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.760
Yeah, I guess that's it's the good first question and the answer of course again as usual is it depends and

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.900
I suppose we can discuss different perspectives

9
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.500
The first one is you are somebody that already has some degree of experience with AWS or the cloud in general

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.240
And in that case, maybe it's a little bit trickier to say yes or no

11
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.200
It yeah, it depends on your current situation

12
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.640
But most likely it's gonna add less value to you because you already have experience you can probably prove

13
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.980
In your workplace or if you're doing an interview that you already know your stuff and you don't need a certification

14
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.140
But if you are just starting your cloud journey or your software engineering journey, and you are interested in the cloud in general

15
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.780
Trying to get a certification could help you a lot boosting your well first of all your self-confidence

16
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.200
But also going into interviews or trying to grow in your existing workplace

17
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.160
It can be like very beneficial to get that certification

18
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.460
And on the other side other than just the title itself. I think going through the journey of studying for the certification

19
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.260
It's something gives you a very good overview on what are all the different services. What are the things that are more important?

20
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640
How to learn all the different concepts like in which order it makes the most sense

21
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.800
I think a certification is definitely gonna give you all that good

22
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.640
base to keep growing from there

23
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800
Do you agree with this perspective or is there anything else you might want to add?

24
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.920
Yeah, I do agree And my own experience of it as well

25
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.020
I probably previously had that common perception that as long as you had the experience you don't really need the certification

26
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.840
But I've been through the journey with the AWS certification

27
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
and I've also realized that

28
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.400
That kind of perception kind of comes from a position of privilege as well

29
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.080
And it's less true for underrepresented groups in tech

30
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.780
So in the end I've heard many cases where people have said that where you're fighting that bias all the time

31
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.220
Having a certification can really help to overcome that

32
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.360
So I think that's that's really worthwhile to mention because everybody's context is very different

33
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.840
But in general, I think there is a lot of value to certification for a lot of people and it does help for hiring, right?

34
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.160
So it can kind of give you access to better roles and salaries. Like you said it can help you get jobs and

35
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.880
Change your role in your existing company and it really helps for companies that are early on in the cloud journey

36
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.560
If you've got a lot of people already with a lot of experience in-house, it may matter less

37
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.400
But if you're trying to build a lot of expertise, it's something that

38
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.720
boosts credibility, but also helps to

39
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.600
Focus people on AWS and all of the different options available there and also build a culture probably of

40
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.360
Professional development in that area within the company and you'll have people encouraging each other and

41
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.960
Exchanging tips on how to achieve the certifications and when they see other people doing it, they might want to be more encouraged to do it themselves

42
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.400
What do you think are there other areas that

43
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.000
AWS certification is useful for that we didn't mention yet?

44
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:17.200
Yeah, I think another interesting one could be if you are a freelancer or like a consultant as an individual Then having a certification is definitely something it's like a badge that is worth having because it boosts immediately your credibility in the market

45
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.320
But at the same time it's other than the budget itself

46
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.520
There is for instance the AWS IQ platform

47
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.840
Which I think is available in the States and UK maybe some other countries in Europe, I think France

48
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.000
And of course that it's very likely they will open it up to more and more countries in the next few years

49
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.320
But the point is that if you are in that platform

50
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.880
It's a platform managed by AWS where you can find customers as a freelancer and having certification is definitely gonna give you more

51
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.600
Visibility so you'll be able to access more opportunities to get hired for four projects and there is a very good blog post

52
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.120
I think it's a blog post by Adam Elmore where he discussed his own experience

53
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.040
He has achieved all the available certifications and he discussed

54
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:11.560
How doing that and being in that platform has massively increased his chances to get interesting jobs

55
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.480
And grow his freelancing career. So that's an interesting case study

56
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.520
It's probably like the very extreme but it's good to see that that perspective in my opinion

57
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.120
Yeah, it was an interesting one.

58
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.080
He did 12 in six weeks, I think which is a pretty commendable achievement Do you think it's useful for employers? Like if you're an employer you're hiring a lot of people and you're doing a lot on AWS

59
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.280
How do you perceive people who do and don't have AWS certification badges?

60
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.600
Yeah, I think from the perspective of an employer there are definitely two possible positions One is that you are trying to hire somebody and then seeing that certification might be more or less important to you

61
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.600
It's definitely as we said like an additional signal of credibility, but I would say trust but verify

62
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.600
Of course as in anything we know you there is still a factor that you can game a little bit the exam and get certified

63
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.600
So the certification is definitely not a replacement for experience. Make sure you validate that certification

64
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.600
That certification may be asking the candidate for specific examples of projects they've been working on

65
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.600
And what they think is more important. What did they learn? So definitely don't just rely on the certification to hire somebody

66
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.600
On the other hand, if you are an employer you probably want to care about certifications even for the people you already hired

67
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.600
They might be interested in getting a certification and I think if that happens in your company I think you should support that

68
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.600
Especially if AWS is something you basically work on it every day you need that experience

69
00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.600
Allowing your team to get a certification can definitely increase their productivity, can increase their skill

70
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:11.600
But not just that you are also supporting every team member to grow on their career so I think that's definitely something good to do in the company anyway

71
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.600
And my immediate recommendation would be don't just say yes do it but actually support them for real

72
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.600
And that could mean a number of different actions for instance help them to create a study plan

73
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:33.600
Find a portion of their work time that they can spend studying, maybe give them access to paid material

74
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:44.600
And also it could be interesting to pay for the actual exam as a company I think it's more convenient to do that rather than letting them spend their own money on the certification

75
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600
So I would definitely recommend that for employers

76
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:03.600
Yeah absolutely, so we should probably give then an overview quickly of the different certifications available And we've got various tiers right so the first one you would probably start with is the foundational training

77
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.600
You know if you're a developer and or on that track the developer the foundational one is your cloud practitioner certification

78
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.600
And that's going to give you an overview of basic understandings of cloud concepts and the various AWS services

79
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:26.600
And it is what it says, it's a good foundation and I think that's something that you could do without having significant experience

80
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.600
I think they give a guideline of six months of experience with AWS but six months of experience could mean a lot of different things

81
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.600
And it's something you could probably do without having much hands on keyboard experience with AWS

82
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.600
And it'll help you to navigate AWS a little bit better so I'd definitely recommend that for anyone getting started

83
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:52.600
And the next up is associate so then within the higher tiers you've got a division between architect and developer and operations

84
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.600
So I think we've both followed the architect track and you've written a particular blog post around solutions architect

85
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.600
So maybe do you want to talk about that one and how the associate solutions architect works and what it gives you

86
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.600
Yeah I wrote a blog post I think it was almost three years ago at this point so I hope it's not too outdated But I try to give like generic tips from what I've seen so maybe most of them are still relevant

87
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:29.600
But my experience with that particular certification is that it is really good because it really lets you focus on the pillar type of knowledge

88
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:37.600
Like principles of cloud design but also the most interesting services like S3, DynamoDB, EC2

89
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.600
And you really get to learn what are the characteristics of those services and how you should rely on some particular characteristics

90
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.600
Not just the strengths but also the weaknesses of every different service

91
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.600
One thing that it might be a little bit annoying or at least it was for me is that there are a lot of questions that are like very specific

92
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.600
So you end up needing to memorize a lot of concepts like I don't know how to do capacity planning with DynamoDB

93
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.600
There are questions where you really need to do the calculations so you really need to know by heart the different values there

94
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:17.600
Similarly there are questions around the different number of nines that you have for all the different characteristics of S3

95
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.600
Depending on which kind of storage do you end up using

96
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:29.600
So it takes a little bit of effort in memorizing certain concepts so that might be a little bit annoying for some people

97
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.600
But then those things are really useful like you really need to understand why those things are important

98
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.600
So it pushes you in the right direction in my opinion

99
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:44.600
And I'll just leave a link to the article there are a lot more tips in terms of how to manage time, how to do the exam

100
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.600
And also some links to resources that I use to study

101
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.600
But yeah that might take another episode if we want to go too much into detail in that Absolutely, yeah and once you've got your associate then you probably look at professional

102
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.600
I think it's interesting that they say if you're looking at associate you want to have one year experience

103
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600
And then you want to have professional two years

104
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.600
I think I was, I'd been working with AWS for about five or six years before I did any certifications

105
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600
So it's, your mileage is going to vary here

106
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.600
I would suggest that if you're going to do the professional two years of experience is actually not a lot

107
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.600
I mean it would certainly mean that you probably have to study a lot more and put a lot more effort into it

108
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.600
And rely less on your experience and kind of inherent knowledge that you've built up

109
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.600
Professional exam is a good jump in challenge

110
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.600
And it's, I would suggest it's probably harder to bluff

111
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.600
I mean you can always cram and study and just try and memorize everything

112
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.600
But professional is definitely a significant challenge

113
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
I've heard some people describe it as the hardest certification in tech

114
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.600
I don't know if that's true or not or that's just hyperbole

115
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.600
But yeah with a lot of experience it'll help

116
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.600
I'm not somebody who particularly enjoys the exam experience

117
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.600
I know that Adam Elmore in his blog says he loves doing exams

118
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.600
So doing 12 exams in six weeks was enjoyable experience for him

119
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.600
For me it's like pulling teeth so I'm at the other end of the scale

120
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.600
I'm glad to have it over with

121
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.600
But yeah I think if you're doing professional I think there is a lot of credibility associated with that

122
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.600
And it's certainly a good validation of your experience like we said

123
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.600
Yeah I think in the professional one the main difference I'm seeing, I'm preparing for that one right now So take this with a grain of salt

124
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.600
But what I'm seeing by doing the mock exams is that there is a lot more of practical knowledge

125
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:47.600
Most of the questions are you need to build this, what's the best solution for this particular use case

126
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.600
Or there is a particular problem in an existing architecture

127
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.600
What can be the most likely cause for that problem

128
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.600
So you really need to know a bunch of different architecture which is not something you can improvise by just reading around

129
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.600
So I think having that experience makes a lot of difference in being able to pass the exam

130
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.600
One of the things I haven't done is the specialty exam Or the specialty certification track and there are various different ones like advanced networking

131
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.600
Database, machine learning, security

132
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.600
Where do you think those would fit or do you think it's

133
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.600
Is it for people who are really specialists or do you think it's also something that if you're like an AWS generalist

134
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.600
It would also be worthwhile pursuing one of those

135
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600
Yeah I haven't done them so again I have a very kind of distant opinion So take it again with a grain of salt

136
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:52.600
But my guess would be that you can either be somebody that is building up interest in a particular area that you haven't been exposed to

137
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:59.600
So you might take that certification as almost like a challenge to see what that area of AWS looks like

138
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.600
What kind of knowledge do you need to build

139
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.600
And maybe you will end up learning a bunch of new things and why not decide maybe to do a little bit of a career switch

140
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.600
To specialize even more in those areas

141
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.600
So that's definitely an extreme. The other case could be that you already have a lot of knowledge in that area

142
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:25.600
So you want to get certified that you know your stuff and maybe that can give you access to more specialized roles in your existing company

143
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.600
Or maybe do interviews for very specialized roles that you are seeing in companies that you really like

144
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.600
So maybe that's another option why you should consider one of those kind of certifications

145
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.600
Yeah this is a good one For people actually thinking about the exam or about to embark on it or in the middle of study

146
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.600
How do you suggest preparing for the exams

147
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.600
You mentioned your blog post which will definitely link in the show notes

148
00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.600
And I suppose I've got mixed experience you know experience is obviously good preparation

149
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.600
You need to look at the certification guide and see what the topics and syllabus is

150
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.600
But there's plenty of resources out there sometimes it's a mind boggling array of content

151
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.600
So I know that when I was looking at the professional exam I was using a cloud guru which is incredibly popular

152
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.600
And a lot of companies use it and a lot of individuals use it

153
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.600
I found it to have slightly mixed advantages and disadvantages

154
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:38.600
In that it was very good content a really good platform and the sandbox environments they give you to experiment with stuff is very useful

155
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.600
One of the things I found is that it seemed to lack a little bit of depth

156
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.600
And that a lot of the detailed topics which are required for professional level weren't explored in a lot of great detail

157
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.600
But instead they just told you to go and read the white papers

158
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.600
So I think it's worth stating that I found you know it's definitely worth looking at

159
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.600
It's just at that professional level I thought it could do with some more detail

160
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:09.600
And one of the other platforms I found other people recommend quite a lot for that is Adrian Cantrell's platform

161
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.600
Which is you know his own platform but he's got a lot of detailed tutorials there so we'll link that through as well

162
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.600
You mentioned the practice exam so where do people go to get practice and to see what they're like

163
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.600
Because that's something you could do even before you apply for the exam just to get a sense of readiness

164
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:41.600
Yeah as far as I know I have been doing the mock exams in three different platforms One is a Cloud Guru itself they do have that feature as well and I think that one is actually quite well done

165
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.600
Because it doesn't just give you like okay correct answers you did pass or you did not pass

166
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:55.600
But for every single question after you do the exam you have an entire like in-depth section that tells you how to approach that question

167
00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:02.600
In the case you failed why maybe you failed it like maybe some tips on okay look for this keyword next time

168
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:09.600
Because that really has a lot of value so it can give you I think it can give you like a good way of approaching the exam

169
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:16.600
Even if you just fail it I think you will just learn a lot on how to approach the next time you try to do the exam

170
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:26.600
Similarly there is one on Udemy that I'm currently using for studying for the professional certification which is built pretty much in the same way

171
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:35.600
It's a mock exam you get the time that you really get during the exam you try to answer the questions and at the end you get your own score

172
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.600
But also for every single question you get a lot of context and suggestions

173
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:47.600
And then there is the AWS itself allows you to do practice exam I think you need to pay some small fee to do that

174
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:56.600
But I would recommend doing that before any exam because chances are that the AWS one is much closer to the one we will actually have to face during the exam

175
00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:06.600
In terms of actual content and type of questions so these are the three I know and I used in the past I don't know if you have anything else there

176
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:22.600
I've also used the Udemy ones which I think are essentially resold from the tutorials point Tutorials is the same content and you know they're relatively inexpensive and they're often discounted to like 20 euros that level

177
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:28.600
The one thing I found about them is that I thought they were more challenging than the real exam

178
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:36.600
So from that point of view it's quite good because it sets a higher bar than the actual exam and I found that the questions were often longer, took longer to read

179
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:47.600
A lot more subtle detail in them. In fact the first time I did a cloud partitioner mock exam with Udemy it really frightened me into getting my act together

180
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.600
Because it was so challenging and I flunked it so badly the first time

181
00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:03.600
I think that's good right because it really helps you to prepare by really setting a high bar and then you actually find that the exam itself isn't so bad

182
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.600
So I really recommend those

183
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:13.600
What about during the exam itself? So you've got two options for the exam now

184
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.600
Previously I think you could only do the foundational level ones online and everything else you had to go to a test centre

185
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.600
But with Covid everything is now available through what they call online proctoring

186
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.600
There are two platforms for that one is Pearson View and the other is PSI

187
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.600
And I've had experience with Pearson View and I know other people who have had experience with both

188
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:47.600
And I just wanted to relay some of my experience with those because there's good and bad

189
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:55.600
If you can get to a local test centre safely and do your exam I would probably recommend that because you don't have to worry about the environment

190
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.600
You just turn up, sit at a desk, do the exam and leave with your result

191
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.600
When you do the online proctoring it's an advantage that you can do it from your office or from your home

192
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.600
But you really have to make sure that the environment is correct so in advance you have to make sure that the room is clear, your desk is clear

193
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.600
There's no devices or books or paper within reach

194
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:24.600
You will have to use your phone to take a picture of your environment from all angles and somebody's watching you for the duration of the exam

195
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:32.600
And it's quite amusing sometimes because if you're thinking about a question and you're focusing and you might put your hand over your mouth

196
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:40.600
Or you might mumble to yourself they'll tell you to stop because they don't know that you're trying to communicate with somebody outside the room

197
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.600
Or you're trying to work around the system in some way or cheat

198
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.600
So it's a little bit amusing and kind of restrictive in that sense, you have to put time into preparing for it

199
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.600
And the platform doesn't always work unfortunately

200
00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:02.600
The first one I ever did with online proctoring didn't work at all, I had to cancel it and it took weeks before I was able to reschedule it

201
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.600
Which is really inconvenient

202
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.600
I know a colleague of ours at Fortheram had that same experience recently, it's no fun when that happens

203
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.600
And I've heard about problems with the actual platform on both options there

204
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.600
So there are pros and cons to it, it is nice that you have that option to do it online

205
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:26.600
But you really have to prepare, make sure the environment's working and then hope that it just works on the day

206
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:33.600
And I'm sure it usually does but you know things happen, it's technology

207
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:41.600
What about other preparation? During the exam itself Luciano, I think you had a lot of good recommendations on how to approach the exam in your blog post

208
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.600
Do you want to talk about some of those?

209
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.600
Yeah, I think at least what was my approach after failing a few mock exams I started to develop a little bit of a system for how can I be more effective

210
00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.600
Because I think the main concern is that it's not just challenging because of course it's an exam, you need to have the knowledge, there is a stress factor

211
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:12.600
But also from what I've seen it's very tight, you have a certain amount of time and a lot of questions and you need to really manage your time well

212
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:22.600
So what I would recommend is be aware of the time but also don't let that stress you out, don't freak out just because you see the counter going down

213
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:32.600
Try to focus on the questions, try to allocate enough time for you to understand the question well enough

214
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.600
And I think when you start to do a few mock exams you'll start to realize that there are some patterns

215
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.600
For instance some keywords will have a certain weight in a question or even in an answer

216
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:51.600
Another thing that happens often is that you have to pick between possible answers and some of the answers are almost identical

217
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.600
So basically there is one or a few keywords of difference between each other

218
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.600
So most of the time that means that the choice is either one or another question so you can probably ignore the other two

219
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.600
But that means that it's really important that you understand the difference between those few keywords

220
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:18.600
So really try to do the exercise of seeing, okay, this is just not the most likely answer because there is another one that is almost identical

221
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.600
So try to focus on finding out what's the difference, why the difference might be important

222
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:32.600
And other than that if you see that you are spending too much time on one question there is an option to flag the question you don't have to answer straight away

223
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:42.600
So you can leave it for the end and do all the other questions and then before submitting your results, your answers, you can go back to the flagged ones

224
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.600
And try to figure it out with a fresher mind if you can understand what the question means and if you can find a good answer for it

225
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.600
Those are I think my basic suggestions, I don't know if you have anything else

226
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:18.600
No, I'd agree with that, yeah, if you've got time left over at the end rather than walking out early take the time to review the answers and flagging the ones where you had some doubt is a good idea I'm really interested to hear what other people's experiences are with certification and if people have any questions about approaching certification we'd love to help and we'd love to learn more about what other people's experiences are
