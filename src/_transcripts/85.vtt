00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Last week, we attended the AWS Summit Conference in London.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.800
It was a great event and we came back with tons of learnings

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.500
and to be fair, even some good amount of swag.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.200
But it was an event with close to 100 talks and thousands of participants.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.800
So in this kind of events, it might be very easy to get lost

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.900
and miss the opportunity to take the most value out of that particular day

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
you spent at the conference.

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.300
In this episode, we want to share some tips

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
to make sure that you can enjoy this kind of events

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
and feel like they were really worth your time and energies.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.300
My name is Luciano and today I'm joined by Eoin

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.500
and this is AWS Bites podcast.

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.500
AWS Bites is sponsored by fourTheorem,

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.800
an advanced AWS consulting partner that works together with you

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
on architecture, migration and cost optimization.

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.900
You can find out more at fourtheorem.com.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.600
You'll find this link in the show notes.

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
So I want to start by giving a very quick description

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.900
of the kind of events we're talking about

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.700
because there is definitely no shortage of AWS related events.

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.300
There are lots of community activities, there are meetups

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.100
and these events can be at very different scales.

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000
The ones we want to focus about today are the ones that tend to be

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.200
a little bit more on the large side of this scale.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.400
So where we have thousands of participants

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
and they might have multiple tracks happening at the same time.

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.400
You might have lots of space for companies showcasing their products.

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.900
And generally you are in this very large space filled with thousands of people

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.900
and it might be very complicated to figure out exactly how should I spend my time.

30
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.000
And those kind of events are the summits like the one we just mentioned in London.

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.100
And there are other events that are quite similar.

32
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.200
For instance, the reinforce and reinvent which to be fair,

33
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
I personally haven't been in those ones.

34
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
So I'm just extrapolated that they would be similar if not even more chaotic.

35
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.800
So I expect that some of the advices we are going to share today

36
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.600
are also very valuable if you attend some of these other events.

37
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.400
But I guess we can be proven wrong.

38
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.100
So if you think you have been at those events

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.900
and you have a different experience, hopefully you'll let us know

40
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.400
and that will be a topic to discuss more for the next episodes.

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.200
So one question that we often get from people we talk to

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
that are interested in AWS is I really like to attend,

43
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.700
but it's sometimes a bit difficult to convince my employer to let me go for the day

44
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
and travel and maybe refund the cost of all of that.

45
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.600
So how can people actually justify the value?

46
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.900
What do you think, Eoin?

47
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.000
Well, it's kind of an event because they're quite a big event,

48
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.600
but they're also just typically one day events

49
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.700
and not too far away because they're in various different locations around the world.

50
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.000
While we were in London on the same day, there was another one in Washington DC.

51
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.100
So they're quite regular at this point.

52
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.700
And we've also had like recent events here as well,

53
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.300
like the AWS Community Day in Dublin and before that was AWS Cloud Day in Dublin

54
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.000
and we got an opportunity to go to all of them

55
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and they're all a little bit different, but they're all just one day commitments.

56
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.500
So it's not too bad, because you're not traveling very far, it's not too expensive.

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.800
So it shouldn't take that much to convince yourself and your employer.

58
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.600
I guess the main thing is just taking a day out of whatever else you're doing,

59
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.800
getting your head out of the weeds.

60
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.900
It really helps a lot to do that.

61
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.700
So the two things you're really getting out of it is learnings

62
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.400
and then just meeting people, people you know and new people as well.

63
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.600
But if you're working with AWS, attending this kind of event

64
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.100
is going to have a positive impact in general in your career and your day-to-day job.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.600
So it should be a benefit for your employer.

66
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.800
It should help you to come back with ideas and ways of working better

67
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.200
and improve solving challenges you have.

68
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.400
So you can share with your employer what kind of topics will be covered

69
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.700
and show how they're relevant to your day-to-day job

70
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.500
and the challenges you might have with them.

71
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.200
It's also an opportunity to meet vendors and vendors are there to sell something.

72
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200
So sometimes you might be a bit allergic to that

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
and be a bit afraid of being targeted for sales.

74
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.700
But at the end of the day, most of these vendors are trying to solve problems

75
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.400
that are commonly relevant for AWS practitioners.

76
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.600
So you should keep an open mind and be open to learning something

77
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.200
and maybe replacing something you've built in-house with a third-party solution

78
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.400
or just meeting vendors you already have and figuring out how to do things better.

79
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.300
I'd say it's an opportunity to meet industry experts like as well

80
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.900
and people you only know from Twitter and YouTube,

81
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.600
including your favorite podcast hosts.

82
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.500
But the other advantage is that these events,

83
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.200
especially the vendor events organized by AWS are free.

84
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.800
Apart from all the data you have to give away when you go around the stands,

85
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800
but in monetary terms, they're free.

86
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
So even though they take time and energy from you,

87
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
they don't have a sign-up cost like a lot of conferences,

88
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400
which can be more expensive.

89
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
So let's say you've convinced your employer,

90
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.900
what do you need to do next, Luciano?

91
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900
So this is just before the event.

92
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.400
Probably you want to start to think about that a bit in advance,

93
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.700
maybe a month or so, because generally these events are planned way ahead

94
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.400
so you can actually plan as well yourself.

95
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.500
And there are a few reasons why it is important to just don't do it the very last minute.

96
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.300
Sometimes there is limited availability.

97
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.600
So of course, the sooner you register your spot,

98
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.900
the more peace of mind you have that you secure your presence at the event

99
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.900
and you can just go.

100
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.400
If you do the very last day, maybe there is no more availability

101
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.400
and you lost that opportunity.

102
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600
Very similarly, if you have to book flights and hotels

103
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.900
because you have to travel a little bit, that could be another problem.

104
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.900
Of course, the sooner you do it, the cheaper and the easier is to find places for staying.

105
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.900
It's also really important to check the agenda.

106
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.400
Now, the agenda doesn't always come too early.

107
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700
It is actually updated very close to the event in my experience,

108
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.000
but at least a couple of days before the event,

109
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.700
it should be there and it should be quite complete.

110
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.300
I would recommend people to check the agenda

111
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.200
and bookmark the things that are more interesting to you.

112
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.700
As we said in London, there were, I think, something around 70 or more talks.

113
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.400
So there is a lot of talks and they happen all in parallel.

114
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.500
It's important to just don't randomly go and attend talks.

115
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
Talks you need to have a plan.

116
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.200
The good news is that there is a mobile application called AWS Events

117
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.400
that can simplify organizing the talks you want to attend,

118
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.600
creating some kind of virtual agenda that then you can easily visualize

119
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.900
to understand which talks are happening next in which room,

120
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.000
and you can go there in time.

121
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.500
This app is available for both Android and iOS.

122
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.200
We will put the links in the show notes.

123
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.700
I have a very small feedback.

124
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.800
If somebody from AWS is listening, please make it work offline

125
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.700
because sometimes the connectivity at these events is not great.

126
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.300
And yeah, if it doesn't work offline,

127
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.300
you might not be able to rely on this application sometimes.

128
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.000
Now, one advice that I have is that it's very tempting to put,

129
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.200
to squeeze a lot of talks in your agenda

130
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.800
because they are effectively one after the other,

131
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.500
but they don't necessarily happen in the same room.

132
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.800
So you might have to walk sometimes even quite a bit

133
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.000
to just go from one talk to the other.

134
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.400
And therefore, my suggestion is try to put gaps in between sessions

135
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.000
just because you have to probably spend sometimes going to one session to the other,

136
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800
but also sometimes you find long queues to just get in

137
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.900
and you might just be left out of the talk

138
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.100
because the room fills in and there is no more space.

139
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.200
So my advice would be don't try to be too eager

140
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.800
and try to attend all the talks,

141
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.500
but just pick the ones that you really care about

142
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.600
and try to allow yourself a little bit of time between one talk and the next one.

143
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.600
Another last thing that I have on this topic

144
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.100
is there are levels of how much in-depth is that particular talk.

145
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.000
AWS uses this kind of scheme where you have 100, 200, 300, and 400,

146
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.100
and they are increasingly more advanced levels.

147
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.000
So really, depending on your level of expertise,

148
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.100
you can also filter out the talks that are more relevant to you.

149
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.900
And for instance, the 100 ones are very informative.

150
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.800
It's more with this service, you can do this kind of things

151
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.900
and address this kind of problem.

152
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.500
So they are really good if you are just starting with AWS

153
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.800
to just understand what's the landscape,

154
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600
what kind of services you can focus about,

155
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600
and get some use cases out of it.

156
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.000
But if you already have experience with AWS,

157
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.100
sometimes they are really not adding much value to what you already know.

158
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.000
So you might want to look for the 200, 300, or 400 type of talks.

159
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.800
And again, that might change depending on what is your area expertise.

160
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.600
Sometimes you are very experienced in one particular subject,

161
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.600
but you might want to explore other subjects.

162
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.100
So of course, try to just understand which levels apply the most

163
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.500
based on your specific expertise.

164
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.000
Now, once you get at the event,

165
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.400
what are some of the suggestions that we can share?

166
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.600
Yeah, I like to try and travel the night before actually,

167
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.800
so you can get there early and you're not exhausted.

168
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.300
Because if you're traveling the morning of the event

169
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.200
and traveling back the evening of the event,

170
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.600
the events are tiring enough as they are

171
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.700
because you're standing a lot, talking a lot, walking a lot.

172
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.900
And so for that reason, it's nice to be close by the night before

173
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.700
and then get there earlier

174
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.900
because the registration can be really long queues.

175
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.400
At the London event, it got really busy in mid-morning.

176
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.200
Once, like, I think registration was open at eight,

177
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.900
it was quiet at the start, but then it just gets a bit crazy.

178
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.000
So if you can get there, get registered,

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
sit down and have a cup of coffee

180
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.100
and start meeting people who've done the same,

181
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.300
it's a nice way to start the day and then it sets you up.

182
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.200
Because sometimes, like, the networking part is hard going sometimes,

183
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.400
depending on what kind of mood you're in

184
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.300
and how open you are to that kind of thing.

185
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.000
But if you do it, if you start when it's quiet,

186
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.800
it's often easier to keep going that way.

187
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.600
So once you have everything ready, you have to bring like photo ID.

188
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.500
You can bring your QR code, get there, get registered,

189
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.600
and then you're pretty good to go.

190
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.500
And then you have a more relaxed approach to the day.

191
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.700
Yeah, and then I think the main thing is to focus on meeting

192
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.800
as many people as possible.

193
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.200
So is there any trips you can offer Luciano?

194
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.400
You're a super networker.

195
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400
How can people do more to meet more people?

196
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, that's definitely for me the most important thing.

197
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.100
I generally feel that even if I learn a lot with the talks,

198
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.400
meeting people has a special value,

199
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.800
because I can still find a lot of content from the comfort of my home

200
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.700
or my office, watching YouTube videos, reading articles,

201
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.200
listening to podcasts.

202
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.800
There is definitely no shortage of material where you can learn from

203
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.400
or even just trying things on your own.

204
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.200
It's a good way, but you don't get as many opportunities

205
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.000
to meet people and talk with them.

206
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.200
And I think you can still learn a lot by just talking to people,

207
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.700
listening to their stories and understand what kind of problems

208
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.000
they are trying to solve, how did they solve them,

209
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.900
and then comparing different approaches.

210
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.900
And you can also retain those connections long-term

211
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.700
so you can reach out to people later.

212
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.500
So I think it definitely adds value to you as a professional

213
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.800
to try to meet as many people as possible and share expertise

214
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.900
and build a connection with them.

215
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.900
Now again, it's important to understand that these events can be massive

216
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.800
in the order of thousands of participants.

217
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.800
So if you know that there are specific people you want to talk to at that event,

218
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.900
make sure to talk with them in advance before the event and book a meeting.

219
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.300
And sometimes we already said that there can be connectivity issues.

220
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.400
You don't always get connection.

221
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.800
The Wi-Fi might be pretty saturated.

222
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.400
Also, I found that mobile operators sometimes can be pretty saturated

223
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.500
if you are in an area with hundreds of people at that moment in time.

224
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.800
So sometimes you literally don't have any connection at all.

225
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.600
So if you really want to meet people, make sure to plan in advance also a time

226
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.600
and a place where it might be the best place to have a chat.

227
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.000
Therefore, even if you have no connection, you can just go there

228
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.900
and most likely you are going to meet that particular person.

229
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.600
And another thing, and this also happens to me,

230
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.700
I know I might look like an extrovert, but sometimes I'm also an introvert.

231
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.000
So it might be a little bit scary to just start a conversation with random people.

232
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.300
There are some obvious things that you can do there.

233
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.800
First of all, I think the best moments are when you have either lunch breaks or coffee breaks

234
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.100
or even when you're simply standing in a queue, maybe to go into a room for a talk

235
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.800
or maybe to get your lunch or maybe to do the registration.

236
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.800
I think those are great moments to just exchange a few words.

237
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.500
And I think if you just ask people next to you or in front of you,

238
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.400
hey, what's your name and what do you do, that's already a great way to start a conversation.

239
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.900
So it doesn't have to be anything extremely smart or complicated.

240
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.100
That's the easiest question.

241
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.900
And I think everyone will be happy to reply to that and have a conversation.

242
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:07.300
Some other times there are people that are clearly there trying to promote something,

243
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.600
either their own companies or maybe the company they work for

244
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.600
or maybe they are trying to build a product or maybe they have a podcast.

245
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.400
So they might wear something that tells you,

246
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.500
I am the person behind this in a way or another.

247
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.800
So they might have logos or I don't know names of companies in their t-shirt or in their backpack.

248
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.900
And so another excuse to just start a conversation.

249
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.700
If you think what they do might be interesting, you can just ask,

250
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.200
hey, what's about this name? What do you do?

251
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.000
Tell me a bit more, I'm curious.

252
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.600
And that's another thing that people will be extremely happy to tell you more about

253
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.000
and that can start a conversation and that you can compare maybe different experiences.

254
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.800
I think if you engage with somebody that you feel like it would be great

255
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.400
to keep as a long-term contact, it's important to make sure you exchange some kind of contact.

256
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.400
Now, I'm not suggesting you still print business cards.

257
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.200
I think that's not a practice that most people will do anymore.

258
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.400
Even though it might be nice to kind of give away a business card.

259
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.700
I think these days you can just get on with just using LinkedIn or Twitter or an email.

260
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.000
So just do that and on that I would really recommend,

261
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.400
this is actually a tip that I think it really goes a long way.

262
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.700
If you reach out to the people you engage with after one day or maybe two days,

263
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.700
just saying, hey, it was great meeting you and I don't know,

264
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.800
just make an effort to send a custom message.

265
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.100
Maybe just say it was great to talk about X

266
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.900
and I'd really like to learn about your experience.

267
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.800
I think that will really help you to consolidate that connection

268
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.400
and make sure that if you want to reach out to them in the future,

269
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.300
that connection is still there and it's going to be available for you.

270
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.600
So don't discount how important it could be to just send a simple message like this.

271
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.900
Now, I know that in these events, of course, you can meet a lot of people from AWS itself.

272
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.800
So do you have any suggestion around that?

273
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.300
Because we're AWS partners, we know a lot of people at AWS at this stage.

274
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.700
So we talk to a lot of people we know,

275
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.100
but we also get to meet people that we haven't in person and just try to increase our network.

276
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.500
I always find like when you're working with AWS,

277
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.100
it's a major vendor for everybody if you're adopting AWS,

278
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.100
you really benefit from knowing as many people as possible

279
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.900
across like technology and account management and everything.

280
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.500
So it is always good to meet as many as you can.

281
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.700
I think the first time I went to these conferences,

282
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.700
I always had questions about AWS,

283
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.300
I was always struggling with something

284
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.900
and all of these events tend to have an ask an architect booth

285
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.700
where you can go up and a solutions architect will be available

286
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.300
with a whiteboard and a marker and a laptop and there to answer your questions.

287
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.300
And I've always found that really beneficial.

288
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:47.900
You also find like this AWS stands with demos and community area as well.

289
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.800
So there's plenty of people from AWS and their job is to meet people like you,

290
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.500
no matter where you're coming from

291
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.400
and they're not just there to meet major vendors with multi-million spend on AWS.

292
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.500
They're there to meet everybody.

293
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.900
So you tend to get a lot from trying to trying to meet them.

294
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.400
And then when you have needs for support in the future,

295
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.200
having contacts will really help you.

296
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.800
And as well, if you decide that you want to create content around AWS,

297
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.400
if you're connected to people within the AWS community

298
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.300
and working for AWS itself, this already helps you in the future like that.

299
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.100
So it's always good idea to make as many contacts as possible.

300
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.900
Would you think it's worthwhile spending a lot of time meeting some of the companies

301
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.000
who are really invested in selling to you like sponsors,

302
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.400
partners at these events, Luciano?

303
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.100
Yeah, for instance, in the case of the London event,

304
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.200
there were so many of them, probably the order of like hundreds of booths

305
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.500
that where you can just walk in and talk.

306
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.700
So I would recommend to try to talk with all of them

307
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.800
because that probably wouldn't even have the time in an entire day to talk to all of them.

308
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.900
So of course, be selective will be the first suggestion.

309
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.600
So if there are companies that you are particularly interested in the products

310
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.800
or maybe companies that you already have worked with,

311
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.100
either you use their products or you're thinking to use their products,

312
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.200
I think it might be really well worth it to go there and talk to them.

313
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.600
And I'll give you an example that happened to me in this particular London conference.

314
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.800
I'm not going to mention the vendor just because this,

315
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.000
I don't want to that the episode looks like it's sponsored by them.

316
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.500
But there is a particular vendor that I've been working with for in the context of a project

317
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.900
that we are doing with our customer of ours.

318
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.600
And I have been engaging with some of the people that were actually in person there at the booth.

319
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.100
So I just went by to say, hey, hello, it's finally nice to meeting you in person

320
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.600
because before we just engaged in video calls and emails.

321
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.400
And what actually happened and it was a bit unexpected is that there was there an architect for that particular product

322
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.200
and I was able to have a conversation with them

323
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.900
and talk about some of the things that we were going to do next with that product.

324
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.000
And it turned out that they already had a bunch of examples and a bunch of code material

325
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.500
ready to be shared with us to actually implement all the things that we need to implement next week.

326
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.200
So unexpectedly this is making my job easier for the next week

327
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.800
because I will have a lot of supporting material that I can just use rather than reinventing the wheel.

328
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.100
So again, this is maybe a very specific example.

329
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.600
It's not necessarily guaranteed that something like this is going to happen to you,

330
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.200
but it just goes to show that the more you engage with companies

331
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.800
and people the more it can affect your work positively.

332
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.500
Then another reason might be you just like to collect swag and every company has tons of swag

333
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.500
and actually I'm impressed how more competitive it becomes from a conference to the next.

334
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.700
Yeah, I really like your sunglasses.

335
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.200
And we are not just we are not going to mention the company again just because it's going to look sponsored,

336
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.200
but that's one of the swag we got from that particular conference.

337
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.400
So yeah, definitely that could be another reason to just go

338
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.800
and talk with the companies that you like the most because they might give you a t-shirt,

339
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.200
they might give you other stuff that is of course branded,

340
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.000
but that you might just enjoy adding for yourself.

341
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.500
Now, it's funny that because they're becoming more and more competitive,

342
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.400
I'm seeing very expensive prices. Like I've seen very expensive Lego sets or Nintendo Switch

343
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.700
or PlayStations or keyboards. And of course, you don't just walk in and get those kind of things

344
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.200
because of course, they're very expensive.

345
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.200
They will try to lure you into join this competition or maybe some raffle or something like that.

346
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.700
So you can also play the kind of game if you like to do this kind of things

347
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.400
because they will try to to get some of your data or keep you engaged in a conversation

348
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.500
so that you can participate and try to get the more juicy price.

349
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.200
So that's something that you might want to consider or not, of course.

350
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.900
And of course, if you go for this kind of things, just make sure you have enough room in your luggage

351
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.600
because sometimes I find myself that I really pack my bag and that I don't have any space left

352
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.000
for extra stuff and it becomes a bit of a problem.

353
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Like do I need to throw away something or maybe buy another bag and then check it in?

354
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.500
So just make sure you account for that.

355
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.400
So last thing that I have in this space is that there are also tons of startups.

356
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.100
So companies that are either just starting or they have their first MVP

357
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.400
or maybe they've been in the market but not for long

358
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.800
and now they're trying to figure out what's next for them.

359
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.700
And I find them to be the most interesting companies to talk to just because sometimes

360
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.800
it's really the founders there and you can talk with them

361
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.400
and they will really value talking to you, getting your experience, getting your feedback.

362
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.800
After all, they're trying to build a product that is probably going to try to satisfy some of your needs.

363
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.400
So you are the best person to talk with them and they will really enjoy that

364
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.400
and very easily they can give you access to the product to do a trial

365
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.100
or even discounts or maybe give you free access to some of the new features that they are building.

366
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.100
So I really enjoy to do this kind of things and if there are startups that are doing something

367
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.600
in the space that you are interested in, definitely don't miss the opportunity to go and talk with them.

368
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.100
Now, what about social media stuff for content creation?

369
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.000
What can people do to take advantage of that as well?

370
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.100
Well, I guess you're definitely better at this stuff than me,

371
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.100
but I think there's a couple of things that we can suggest before the event.

372
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.900
Of course, mention on social media that you're going to be there

373
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.900
and you're happy to meet people because then you might get those meetings beforehand

374
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.400
and say what you're interested in and that you'd be happy to talk to people

375
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.300
who are interested in the same kind of thing.

376
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.100
And when people do reach out, book that meeting in advance and name a time and a place

377
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.500
because like you said, at London, network was a disaster, mobile and Wi-Fi.

378
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.000
So it was like being cut off from the rest of the world during the event.

379
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.200
If you can get on the Wi-Fi, post about the things you're doing and like.

380
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.100
And don't just report what you see, but try to add a value with your posts as well.

381
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.900
Like your opinion, additional material, etc.

382
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.900
If you're on Twitter or LinkedIn, you can change your name to name at event

383
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.700
and people will follow you and see that you're there.

384
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.500
And if they're there as well, they might reach out to you.

385
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.400
But you can also show up then in searches

386
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.800
when people are searching for info about the event.

387
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.800
So that will increase the number of people who will engage with you.

388
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.800
And then after the event, you can do like a summary or a blog post.

389
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.900
You can also do videos during the event depending on how much content you want to get into.

390
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.200
But most people won't be at the event.

391
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.600
So you're one of the ones who are there at the event.

392
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.300
There's an audience out there of people who are curious to hear what's new

393
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.000
and what they've missed out on.

394
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.700
So take that opportunity during and after the event as soon as possible to summarize and share.

395
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.900
What other fun stuff can you do while you're there in the channel?

396
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.400
It's not all work and networking.

397
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.300
How can people, you know, get entertained?

398
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.000
Yeah, I actually found that this kind of events, AWS puts a lot of effort to create spaces

399
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.300
where there is more of kind of recreational activities.

400
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.800
But even those activities, they always have a learning angle to it.

401
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.900
So this time in London, there were like Formula One simulators.

402
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.000
There was the AWS DeepRacer competition.

403
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.100
There were spaces where you could play like a deck building card game that was AWS themed.

404
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.700
There is the usual serverless espresso booth where you can just go and all digitally,

405
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.700
you can order your own coffee.

406
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.900
And while that happens, you can learn about the step functions that are actually used in that time

407
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.300
to manage your order and everyone else order and send you a message when your order is ready.

408
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.800
So I think those things might feel like a little bit silly or distracting.

409
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.600
I think that they might be, first of all, just a nice way to just take a break and do something different.

410
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.100
But don't discount again that there is a lot of learning value there as well

411
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.900
because they are all built around the theme of AWS and some of the services

412
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.900
and they're trying a little bit more indirectly to showcase actual use cases of AWS.

413
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.100
So if you look at those things with that lens, I think you can still learn a lot about,

414
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.800
I don't know, how would they build maybe an ordering system.

415
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800
It doesn't necessarily have to be for coffee,

416
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.200
but you could apply those learnings to a similar use case in another industry.

417
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.700
And maybe you already have that use case.

418
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.600
So you could be able to compare what you did with what AWS is doing for that particular implementation.

419
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.900
Sometimes there might be a long queue, but again, if you are bored,

420
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.300
you can just walk out, step into the queue and use that opportunity also to engage with people

421
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.500
and do a little bit of networking.

422
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.900
So definitely just check out these areas and don't think that if you go there,

423
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.000
you are just wasting your time.

424
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.400
Actually, there might be a lot of useful learnings that come out from those in a fun and engaging way.

425
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.400
Have a look out on LinkedIn or Twitter beforehand for some of the vendors who might be arranging for drinks afterwards

426
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.000
or food or other events because they don't tend to, they don't have to go on for very long,

427
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.800
but it is a nice way to kind of get some more networking

428
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.400
and just meet people in a more relaxed environment afterwards.

429
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.300
It's not always about alcohol as well because sometimes some of these events can be a little bit off-putting

430
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.500
if you're not like a serious drinker, you know,

431
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.300
so a lot of the events like you could just go and just have a chat with people

432
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.100
and have a coffee or drink a soft drink or whatever.

433
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.200
Just be careful of people who will try and lead you astray.

434
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.500
That is one warning I'll have to give.

435
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.700
But yeah, especially like it at this time of year in the Northern Hemisphere,

436
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.500
it's getting nice and sunny.

437
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.800
So the afterwards after work after conference events are a nice way to kick back

438
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.400
and just chat to more people and talk about what you learned.

439
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.600
But you do need to register in advance for a lot of those things.

440
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.600
So watch out for the invitations. A lot of them are completely open to anyone attending the event.

441
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.800
You just have to get a ticket in advance because they need to plan numbers and everything.

442
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:16.000
And that's it after that you're free to head home and recover because sometimes as well,

443
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.300
you even if you're just trying to take it easy and not go too intense at these events,

444
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.300
just the fact that you're standing and walking for a full day

445
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.800
and talking to a lot of people and doing a day of work.

446
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.100
That's different to your normal day sitting behind your desktop.

447
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.300
It just takes a lot of ideas. Just account for that

448
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.800
and you're planning for the day afterwards and don't be too ambitious

449
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.400
because you do have to do those follow-ups as well and reach out to everybody who you met at the event.

450
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.800
So a lot of time for that and it'll definitely be worthwhile into the future

451
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.600
because you know, you probably won't get to one of these events every month.

452
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.900
It's more like one or two a year in general.

453
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.400
So make the most of it. Indeed.

454
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.600
Yeah, by the way, I think I waltzed something like 20 kilometers at the LWS Summit London,

455
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.000
which is not necessarily a lot,

456
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.400
but it's definitely way more than my average when I just work sitting at my desk for most of the day.

457
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.900
You're in training for Vegas this year, right?

458
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.900
So that's the start of it. Let's see if you can do 50 in Vegas.

459
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.400
It probably, yeah, from what I'm told, Vegas, it's really intense

460
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.500
and you end up walking a lot between one place to the next one.

461
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.400
So we will see. I'll probably mention something about that online

462
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.800
or maybe in another podcast episode.

463
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.000
But that brings us to the end of this episode.

464
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.700
So we would be really curious to know if you have other tips,

465
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.800
if you enjoyed the ones we just gave away,

466
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.000
and I am actually curious to know what are the events that you want to attend next

467
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.600
because I'm curious to compare which ones interest you

468
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.000
and maybe there are ones that we are going to attend as well.

469
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.400
So maybe it could be a great opportunity to meet in person.

470
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.500
So let us know in the comment section if you are on YouTube

471
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.000
or reach out to us on Twitter or on LinkedIn

472
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.900
and we'll be more than happy to have a chat with you.

473
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.000
Until then, we'll see you on the next one and thank you very much for following along.

474
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Bye.
