1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
AWS expertise is in high demand.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.640
We both work for an AWS consulting partner,

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.960
and we have seen hundreds of applications for roles

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.400
in AWS development, architecture, operations,

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.840
and data engineering.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.400
If you're looking for a role like this,

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.560
whether it is your first of such role,

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.240
or you have lots of experience, this episode is for you.

9
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.720
We are going to share our process, what we look for,

10
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.120
how we try to make it fair,

11
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.200
and give some tips that we hope we're gonna help you

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.880
and people like you to learn the role

13
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.320
that takes your AWS career to the next level.

14
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.160
I am Luciano, and here with Eoin,

15
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.960
this is another AWS Bites podcast episode.

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960
AWS Bites is made possible by the support of fourTheorem,

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.520
an AWS consulting partner that works with you

18
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.600
to make AWS migration, architecture,

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.640
and development a success.

20
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.720
See fourtheorem.com to find out more details about that.

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.200
The link is in the show notes.

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.040
Should we just jump straight and describe the application

23
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.640
and the interview process that we do at fourTheorem, Eoin?

24
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920
Yeah, we're happy to share this

25
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680
and find out what people think.

26
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.080
When we're hiring at fourTheorem,

27
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.920
especially for AWS expertise,

28
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.680
it is important to state that the process

29
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.240
isn't just about testing AWS knowledge.

30
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.080
In general, it's a two-way process

31
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.600
where the candidate and fourTheorem are asking questions

32
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.720
and listening to see whether there's a mutual fit for both

33
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.560
in terms of culture, way of working with them,

34
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.440
way of working and the type of customers we work with,

35
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.080
skills and knowledge, of course,

36
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.040
but also future plans in terms of the company

37
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.840
and growth opportunity for the candidate as well.

38
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
Process in general, like we've evolved this

39
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
over the course of the last five or six years,

40
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.440
and when we get an application or a referral,

41
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.640
we review the candidate.

42
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.040
Sometimes we have a CV and a cover letter, sometimes not.

43
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.760
Sometimes you just get a LinkedIn profile

44
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.360
or maybe you get a referral.

45
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.520
If it looks like a possible fit,

46
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.040
we'll just go for the first interview.

47
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.040
And the first interview is a 30-minute introductory call

48
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.080
with Fiona, who's our amazing founder

49
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.360
in charge of finance and people.

50
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.720
And that's really about listening to the candidate

51
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.640
and giving the candidate an opportunity

52
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.200
to hear about fourTheorem and learn more about us.

53
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.720
And if this indicates a good cultural fit

54
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.680
and the general agreement, we'll go to the next step.

55
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.200
And the next step is a one-hour

56
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.040
kind of conversational interview

57
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.760
with two people usually from fourTheorem.

58
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.520
Those people are generally in senior technical roles,

59
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.760
not exclusively.

60
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.320
And this is where we cover a lot of broad topics,

61
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.200
including the experience, your knowledge,

62
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.000
expectations for you, your future plans,

63
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.160
what you want to do next, not just where you've come from.

64
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.840
We also talk about technical skills,

65
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.960
but then there's the aspects like how people work,

66
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.680
what kind of process they work in traditionally,

67
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.040
what they liked, what they didn't like,

68
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.720
what they'd like to change and do differently,

69
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.880
how they communicate the team ethic

70
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160
and how they like to work with others

71
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.800
and how they have in the past.

72
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.560
And there's no right answers really here.

73
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.320
You know, you don't have to be completely worried

74
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.760
about your previous experience.

75
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.760
It's more how open are you to in general.

76
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.640
It's also a good opportunity for candidates to learn

77
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.600
about how we work at fourTheorem, the kind of projects we do.

78
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.200
So after that, if everybody's still happy,

79
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.600
the next step and the final kind of interview phase

80
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.360
is another interview, but it's a technical interview.

81
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.240
And this is also one hour.

82
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.240
And the candidate has a choice here.

83
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.480
So there's three options.

84
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.320
They can do a collaborative coding exercise

85
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.040
where they start a solution to a brief technical problem

86
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.920
that we present.

87
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.440
Actually, we present two problems and they get to pick one.

88
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920
The other option is a take home coding exercise,

89
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.320
which is the similar kind of thing,

90
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.680
but they just do it on their own time.

91
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.880
And then they come back and present it and discuss it.

92
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.360
And the third option is that they can present a project

93
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.320
that they have already written prior

94
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.840
in like other previous work.

95
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.280
If it's something they can share,

96
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.640
maybe it's an open source project,

97
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.840
maybe it's something they just did for fun,

98
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.720
whatever you have.

99
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.880
So we try overall,

100
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.560
like we try not to take too much of people's time.

101
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.280
In our view, if you take more of people's time,

102
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.840
you should start paying them at that point.

103
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.120
I know that some companies have take home exercises

104
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.800
where they expect people to work for days or weeks.

105
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.200
I just don't subscribe to that.

106
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.040
So let's go into some more detail

107
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.400
and about how all this works.

108
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.560
Luciano, in general, if you think about the roles we are for,

109
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.000
what are the things we're looking for?

110
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.960
Sure, so I will say that in general,

111
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.440
we are looking for technical knowledge and skills,

112
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.200
but I think it's also fair to say that in this industry,

113
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.720
we tend to overemphasize that the importance

114
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.680
of how much technical skills do we need to have

115
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.360
to land a job in IT or technology in general.

116
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.560
I think that level of skills really depends

117
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.880
on the type of role that we are hiring for.

118
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.440
If we are looking for very senior roles,

119
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.360
we have certain levels of expectations,

120
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.560
but I think there is a lot more

121
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.680
that we need to bring in the picture

122
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.000
to really evaluate a candidate.

123
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.160
It's not just about technical skills, for sure.

124
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.120
And just to give a little bit more context,

125
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.800
because context is probably important here,

126
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.160
I think we need to describe a bit how we work at fourTheorem,

127
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.240
because of course that is important

128
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.000
in the way we hire people as well.

129
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.080
The majority of our work is for clients.

130
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.960
So we basically work as architects, engineers,

131
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.960
bringing our expertise with AWS in the context

132
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.120
where a company is trying to migrate

133
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.160
or build a specific system in the cloud.

134
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.640
So most of our expertise is on AWS,

135
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.080
so we try to bring that on board in the project,

136
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.800
but we'll need to be flexible in the sense

137
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.240
that we will be working with a range

138
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.360
of different technologies,

139
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.840
because our customers might be very different

140
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.640
in terms of all the different kinds of technologies

141
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.520
that they use, including software, programming languages,

142
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.640
and even methodologies that they use

143
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.160
to actually work together.

144
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.680
So I think in most cases, it's important to see

145
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.920
when we try to evaluate candidates,

146
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.920
how that ability of being flexible and take ownership

147
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.360
and have conversation with the customers,

148
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.320
it is actually part of the personality

149
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.360
of the person we are trying to interview.

150
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.800
So that's something that is important

151
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.600
to be successful in our company.

152
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.440
So it's a skill and probably like a more characteristic

153
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.240
also of the specific character of the individual

154
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.400
that I think it's very important for us

155
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.000
and sometimes can be as important,

156
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.080
if not more, of technical skills.

157
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.080
And I think that needs to be also mentioned together

158
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.120
with the fact that internally we do a lot of training,

159
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.560
we do certifications, we have acceleration programs,

160
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.240
we try to share as much knowledge as possible,

161
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.520
we try to pair individuals.

162
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.480
So we believe that even if you don't have

163
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.720
the most amazing technical skills,

164
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.200
we will give you the tools to get there.

165
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.840
But I think it's much harder to give you the tools

166
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.760
to learn how to deal in this environment

167
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.280
if you are not already kind of a cultural fit

168
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.280
for the particular kind of environment.

169
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.080
And another interesting point is that going back

170
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.320
to the topic of different levels of skills,

171
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.880
we will be hiring from junior to all the higher level,

172
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.920
like principal, senior, architect,

173
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.960
whatever you want to name them.

174
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.800
So that again, the skill expectation

175
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.440
will be proportional to the level of experience

176
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.720
that we are hiring for.

177
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.640
So I think in general, if I have to summarize a few points,

178
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.480
what we're looking for are people that are curious

179
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.240
to keep learning and building,

180
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.160
even if they are very senior,

181
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.120
I think we want people that still accept

182
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.680
that there is always more to learn,

183
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.400
there are always new methodologies, new technologies,

184
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.360
and it's always a continuous journey of exploring

185
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.040
what is the possible today and trying to do our best

186
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.600
with new tools that we get all the time.

187
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.920
People that are collaborators,

188
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.400
so people that don't just want to work in silos,

189
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.280
just write code all day on their own

190
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.680
and just come back with a fully completed solution.

191
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.920
We actually want people that can have a positive impact

192
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680
in a team, they can have conversations

193
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.280
at the very beginning of a project,

194
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.360
work together on building the project,

195
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.840
reviewing failures and reconsider the approach,

196
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.000
and always be there to try to help each other

197
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.440
on what can we do to do things better,

198
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.400
what can we do to get better as engineers,

199
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.960
and how can we improve our work style,

200
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.440
but also the work that we do with our customers.

201
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.680
And I think to do all of that,

202
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.840
you need to have a certain degree of compassion and empathy,

203
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.600
because that's, I think, kind of a fundamental key

204
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.400
that enables a lot of the conversation

205
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.280
and a lot of the collaboration activities

206
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.320
that we try to promote in our company.

207
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.000
On the technical side, we want people,

208
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.480
as I said before, that are flexible,

209
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.280
so you might have, of course,

210
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.400
your own preferred choice of technology and tool,

211
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.360
but you need to be flexible to work also with other things,

212
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.240
and ultimately, you need to be aware

213
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.080
that there isn't really a silver bullet for things.

214
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.720
All technologies, they will have their own pros and cons,

215
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.280
so you can use all of them probably

216
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.840
to achieve the specific goals that you have.

217
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.240
So another thing that is important is very often

218
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.800
when you join a project that is in progress,

219
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.640
there might have been a lot of decisions

220
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.560
that have been made before you actually started the project,

221
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.880
so that if you just look at the current picture,

222
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.760
there are a lot of things that might look weird or wrong,

223
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.840
and I'm sure that that happens all the time to everyone,

224
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.160
but I think you can have an attitude of just saying,

225
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.120
this is wrong, we should have done this differently,

226
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.840
or a much better attitude,

227
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.280
which is the one that we will prefer,

228
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.080
is to start to ask questions like, why are we doing this?

229
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.400
Have we considered that?

230
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400
Is there anything that we can experiment

231
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.440
to see if it's a more viable solution?

232
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.520
And I think that most of the time

233
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.400
that I've done that in my career,

234
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.560
I have found that actually

235
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.920
there is a very interesting history

236
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.240
that led the project to be in that stage,

237
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.840
and you can learn a lot from that history,

238
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.920
and that can give you a lot of insights

239
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.760
on what you can be doing next.

240
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.120
And if you just look at the current static picture,

241
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.360
it's only telling you a very small portion of the story,

242
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.920
and it's probably not enough for you to be successful.

243
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.600
So we want to really make sure

244
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.200
that people will have that kind of attitude,

245
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.560
or at least that they can be open

246
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.440
to approach projects in that way.

247
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.600
And other couple of things,

248
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.200
and I'm gonna speed up just not to bore you too much,

249
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.040
is that we are just looking for people

250
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.240
that are not expected to know everything,

251
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.080
but are more aware that they don't know everything,

252
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.560
but they know that they can learn

253
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.520
and what to do to unblock themselves,

254
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680
what to do when they need to ask for help.

255
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.480
And if there is a project with lots of unknowns,

256
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.040
they can work with that and figure out

257
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.760
how to move it to a better place

258
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.320
where all these unknowns are slowly being addressed,

259
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.840
and we move to a position with more certainty.

260
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.120
And the last point is that we really appreciate

261
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.200
not over-engineering things.

262
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200
Sometimes it's very easy,

263
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.240
especially when you're starting a new Greenfield project

264
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.000
to over-engineer everything

265
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.920
and just try to do everything in your perfect ideal way,

266
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.520
but we still need to be pragmatic

267
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.560
because at the end of the day,

268
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.800
we are working with businesses.

269
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.240
Businesses will have specific needs, goals, timelines.

270
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.240
So sometimes you need to find the right trade-off

271
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.040
between what can we achieve in a short term

272
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.880
that gives value and then take an iterative approach

273
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.000
to keep improving things,

274
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.800
rather than just trying to make it perfect at the first go

275
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.120
and maybe take months and months

276
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.800
before you can deliver something that the business can use.

277
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.640
So one final point I have,

278
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.280
I already said that that was the final point,

279
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.360
but there is one last one,

280
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.600
is that you might see us doing a lot of public speaking,

281
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.240
podcasts, and so on.

282
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.920
This is not necessarily the only kind of people we hire

283
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.760
because we appreciate that it's not for everyone

284
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.360
to be engaged in public speaking,

285
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.200
and you can still be an amazing professional

286
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.440
even without doing all of these activities.

287
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.120
So if you think that you need to be a public speaking person

288
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120
or a very public profile

289
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.200
just to be able to work with a company like fourTheorem,

290
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.880
we definitely don't think that that's the case.

291
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.680
So just want to make sure that that's clear.

292
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.160
That's definitely not a prerequisite.

293
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.800
What about the application?

294
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.680
So let's just say that we receive a CV

295
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.920
or we receive an introduction.

296
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.480
What do we do at that point?

297
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.480
The CV, LinkedIn, referral, email, or all options,

298
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.640
we may just ask for a CV further down the line

299
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.280
just as it helps with the interview process.

300
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.520
We don't use any kind of automated software

301
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.600
for interviewing people.

302
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.280
First of all, we just review all the CVs

303
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.480
and the applications and just discuss them

304
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.800
before deciding whether to proceed or not.

305
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.960
I suppose in the past, we had some kind of organic growth

306
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.520
and we've been fortunate enough to hire people

307
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.720
just from our network.

308
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.800
And also just because people hear about us

309
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.200
and like what we do, we get applications directly.

310
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.800
We've managed to get a decent, I suppose,

311
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.240
proportion of high quality candidates.

312
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.680
And we generally don't use recruiters

313
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.680
and take unsolicited applications.

314
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.240
When the profile is an internal referral,

315
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.640
we generally get a little introduction

316
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.280
from the person who may have worked with them in the past,

317
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.640
introducing the profile and thinking,

318
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.680
saying whether they think they're a good fit for fourTheorem.

319
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.920
It is important to note that the person

320
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.320
who does the referral won't be involved

321
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.680
then in the interview process,

322
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.680
just to keep it as unbiased as possible.

323
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.800
It's also important to notice

324
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.760
that you don't have to have a computer degree.

325
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.320
You don't have to have a degree.

326
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.400
I've hired great people with computer degrees,

327
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.720
computer science degrees,

328
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.360
also have seen applications from people who do

329
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.480
and haven't had great application success.

330
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.000
I've also worked with great people

331
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.640
who've got different degrees in different fields

332
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.080
or none at all, and just have great experience

333
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.680
and just a real passion.

334
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.120
So those things are not hard requirements at all.

335
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.920
And you don't have to have an AWS certification either.

336
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.320
I mean, these things may help

337
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.040
just to show some basic level of knowledge.

338
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.640
We talked about that in the previous episode,

339
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.120
which we can link in the show notes about certification.

340
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.600
It can be helpful in some situations,

341
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.640
but it's not the be all and end all.

342
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.960
So once we have the application,

343
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.600
as long as you put a good bit of effort

344
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.800
into presenting the application well,

345
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.600
we'll go to the next step,

346
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.400
which is the all important Fiona chat.

347
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.920
I like the title.

348
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.040
We should rename it internally like that.

349
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.480
But yeah, this conversation is the first starting point

350
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.800
is more just to have a first impression on both sides

351
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.400
of what the company looks like,

352
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.960
what the opportunity looks like,

353
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.720
and for us is to have an opportunity

354
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.600
to get an impression on the candidate.

355
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.240
Generally, the topics that are being discussed is

356
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.800
what can we offer as a company?

357
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.520
So what is the work-life balance that we try to promote?

358
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.960
We are a remote company, so we work remotely.

359
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960
We don't even have an office.

360
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.360
So that's an element that we present at this stage

361
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600
and that some people might like it, some people not,

362
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.920
but it's something we need to make very clear very early on.

363
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.760
Then we also talk about what can we offer

364
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.160
in terms of bonuses scheme, holidays, and other benefits.

365
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.640
And in general, I think it's an important conversation point

366
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.200
to get a feeling for what the future will look like

367
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.120
on both sides for the company itself,

368
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.800
like what are our plans for the future,

369
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.920
but also if you are gonna be part of this company,

370
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.080
how can you expect to grow in the company, in your role,

371
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.160
what can be basically the evolution of your profile

372
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.320
if everything goes well in this particular engagement.

373
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.640
So this part of the interview isn't very technical.

374
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.720
So it's more about cultural fit.

375
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.600
It's more about understanding if there is a common ground.

376
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.120
And then if we see that there is a receiver

377
00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.400
or expectation that is aligned,

378
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.920
then we can decide to move on.

379
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.520
Otherwise, I think that that's probably the point

380
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.000
where the interview stops.

381
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.920
But let's say that everything is great.

382
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.440
What do we do next?

383
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.280
The next one that this conversational interview

384
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.400
we mentioned at the start,

385
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.640
it's I think at the one I really try to focus on the most,

386
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.160
I think, and in it, we cover your experience.

387
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.440
If you have some experience,

388
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.200
this depends completely on the level you're at

389
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.480
and what stage you're at in your development career.

390
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.360
When you're talking through your experience,

391
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.040
I would say don't just talk through the technologies,

392
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.320
but also the process, the business goals,

393
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.400
the business context,

394
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.160
having awareness of that wider picture

395
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.400
is really interesting for us

396
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.800
because we're working in that way with our customers.

397
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.480
So we would ask questions about how you work in a team,

398
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.800
what process you like and how you've addressed challenges.

399
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.160
We're also kind of interested in cases

400
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.000
where you help others, collaborate with others,

401
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.400
maybe mentor others,

402
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.040
and also where you're open to help.

403
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.240
So showing that you have some humility

404
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.400
is very valuable here.

405
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.680
Are you open to listening and learning from other people?

406
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.440
Even people who are more junior,

407
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.880
this is a very good indicator

408
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.920
in terms of the principles of empathy,

409
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.560
openness, humility, curiosity.

410
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.960
Everybody has a voice in the company.

411
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.680
So if you think just because you've got 15 years experience

412
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.320
that you shouldn't listen to graduate engineers

413
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.760
because they can't know any more than you,

414
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.560
then that's probably not a great fit.

415
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.040
We would, of course, have questions from the candidate then

416
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.560
about fourth year and how we work,

417
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.240
what our projects are like, what our customers are like.

418
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.080
And then if we're hiring for an AWS role, of course,

419
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.520
we'll ask you what you've done with AWS,

420
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.120
what services you've used and how you have used them.

421
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.040
It's not about listing off 250 services.

422
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.160
There is no number to reach at this stage.

423
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.360
It's more a question of how you use them

424
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.720
and depth certainly more important than breadth

425
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.440
in this case.

426
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.120
Maybe some interesting story about challenges

427
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.600
you faced with AWS is interesting.

428
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.120
And then sometimes we ask general questions,

429
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.600
technical questions.

430
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.120
So an example is like,

431
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.480
how would you build a landing zone page with a signup form

432
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.760
for some case that we would devise?

433
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.800
And usually it's a very simple question

434
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.240
or at least a simple challenge that we're presenting.

435
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.000
So we're not trying to trick anybody.

436
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.360
It's not a really intense kind of a question.

437
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.000
It's just understanding how would you go about

438
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.040
thinking about a set of business challenges

439
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.920
and turning it into an architecture or a piece of software.

440
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.960
And one hint I would give here,

441
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.360
and maybe it's a little bit of a spoiler,

442
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.960
but you don't always have to use AWS

443
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.600
when you're describing solutions.

444
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.920
And if you think you do,

445
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.920
then that might actually work a little bit against you.

446
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.760
It's a very positive sign for us to see people

447
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.760
who don't just reach for AWS every time,

448
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.040
especially when there are simpler,

449
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.040
better solutions for the customer out there.

450
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.520
Sometimes the simplest better solution for the customer is

451
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.600
don't build anything.

452
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.640
There's an off the shelf solution, for example,

453
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.560
or don't build anything.

454
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.880
There's no business value in that.

455
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.120
It's not worth the effort.

456
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.600
You know, those are equally valid answers

457
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.080
for there are customers.

458
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.920
So that's really good if you can show anything like that.

459
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.880
So then we'll also discuss,

460
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.840
because there's time generally here,

461
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.560
what life at Fora theorem is like,

462
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.360
and begin to hopefully paint a picture in the candidate's

463
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.720
mind about what it might be like if they decided to go ahead

464
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.120
and get a job at Fora theorem.

465
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.040
We've had the half hour chat with Fiona,

466
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.320
this round about an hour on the conversational interview.

467
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.720
We've got one hour left of people's time,

468
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.520
and that's the technical interview.

469
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.360
I think this can be daunting for people, the idea of this.

470
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.320
Nobody likes to feel like they're in the spotlight

471
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.680
being tested on their technical prowess.

472
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.160
Hopefully we've got some solution to that.

473
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.120
What do you think Luciano?

474
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.640
Have we solved that problem here?

475
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.080
I hope so, but I have to be fair because I am one of those people that enjoys doing the kind of art core coding

476
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.520
challenge and type of interview.

477
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.800
And I've been practicing that a lot.

478
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.960
So I think for a long time,

479
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.760
I had an expectation that that was the way to do interviews

480
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.440
for everyone, but I'm glad that in Fora theorem,

481
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.160
we all recognize that it might not be for everyone.

482
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.640
Different people might not necessarily shine

483
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.960
in this kind of setup.

484
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.840
And that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have the

485
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.560
technical skills we're looking for.

486
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.880
So one of the things that we do is we try to offer

487
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.160
different options.

488
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.040
We try to offer not just a coding exercise on the spot,

489
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.440
let's do something together,

490
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.840
let's solve a specific short problem.

491
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.640
It could be also, if you have a project you have been

492
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.320
working on, you can present it and then based on that,

493
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.560
we can ask you questions and we can have a conversation

494
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.760
about that.

495
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.880
And our alternative is that if you prefer to build

496
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.040
something which needs to be short,

497
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.920
you can just do it as a tech home exercise,

498
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.520
but we wouldn't expect you to spend more than a few hours

499
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.360
working on it.

500
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.600
And then we just use this extra hour to discuss your

501
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.640
solution.

502
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.560
So we have these options and based on the option,

503
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.600
the interview might be a little bit different,

504
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.440
but in general,

505
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.160
I think it's worth remarking that the coding bit or the

506
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.240
coding assessment ability bit is still important,

507
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.320
but not the most important part,

508
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.600
because what we care the most is how do we work with this

509
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.960
particular person?

510
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.880
How easy it is to basically understand what is their

511
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.960
approach, what they're thinking about a specific problem.

512
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.440
If they understand the requirements,

513
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.120
if they are specific questions to clarify some of the

514
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.720
requirements,

515
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.680
it doesn't matter too much if they complete the problem and

516
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.560
solve it in the most perfect solution.

517
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.320
It's more about this entire process,

518
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.960
this entire conversation and this kind of collaboration

519
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.360
experience.

520
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.200
And I think in general,

521
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.200
our position is that you can get better at coding

522
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.600
throughout your career,

523
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.720
but to have the kind of communication skills that we are

524
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.560
looking for,

525
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.440
it is a little bit more difficult to develop those if it's

526
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.800
not part of your character.

527
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.600
So we try to balance the interview in that way,

528
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.120
trying to put more emphasis on,

529
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.880
are you the right fit for this team?

530
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.960
If you are,

531
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.920
even if you don't have all the skills we need right now,

532
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.680
you can develop them easily.

533
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.200
Otherwise it's probably going to be a much harder

534
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.040
conversation.

535
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.760
So I think in general,

536
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.160
ER is just important to establish that relationship with

537
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.000
the candidate,

538
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.280
make sure that there is good communication,

539
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.960
make sure that there are enough technical skills.

540
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.720
And I think that would be probably more than enough to,

541
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720
to pass the interview,

542
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.400
but I think there are some common mistakes that people will

543
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.240
do.

544
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.760
So can we give people suggestions to,

545
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.480
to avoid some of these mistakes?

546
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.120
Yeah, let's try to do that.

547
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.920
I was also just going to say as well Luciano,

548
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.680
because we've emphasized communication quite a lot,

549
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.480
and I don't want people to get the impression that we're

550
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.200
talking about looking for people who've got like perfect

551
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.000
English or super eloquent or have a great vocabulary.

552
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.840
It's not,

553
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.440
it's more about being open to listening and asking when you

554
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.920
need help or being willing to communicate ideas.

555
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.680
So it's not,

556
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.960
it's not about having perfect English and about being an

557
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.240
extrovert for sure.

558
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.920
Where lots of us at fourTheorem are more kind of social

559
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.760
introverts.

560
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.160
So we completely understand if people aren't like super

561
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.560
outgoing and bubbly,

562
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.560
you don't have to be a great talker.

563
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.800
It's, it's more about great communicator.

564
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800
And there's a big difference there.

565
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.200
It's more about, can you work with other people?

566
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.360
And I think people generally know what we mean,

567
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.920
hopefully when we say that.

568
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.240
When we talk about common mistakes,

569
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.280
one that I think comes up quite frequently and is a real

570
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.440
shame is when we see people just not listening or letting

571
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.760
the interview speak, interviewer speak properly.

572
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.320
Sometimes this can,

573
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240
we all understand that people are sometimes nervous in this

574
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.080
case.

575
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.200
So we'll always try to take that into account.

576
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.560
But if people are just trying to dominate the conversation

577
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.240
and talk over the interviewer and present their ideas and

578
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.920
kill the conversation from the other side,

579
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.400
that's not a great indicator for collaboration and just

580
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.520
dominating the conversation in general is not a good look.

581
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.720
Especially in the technical interview,

582
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.320
I've seen lots of technically proficient people who don't

583
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.280
end up getting an offer because they just want to take full

584
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.920
ownership of the solution and present it as their work.

585
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.800
And we try to present it and make sure that people know that

586
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.760
it's a collaborative coding interview where we kind of talk

587
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.200
together and we see how we would work together.

588
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.840
It's not about showing what a rockstar you are,

589
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.840
because that's really not what we're looking for at all.

590
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.120
It's actually a big turn off.

591
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.360
We're looking for people who can work with our clients,

592
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.560
listen to them, collaborate,

593
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.600
who show that humility will ask questions when they need it.

594
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.280
And we say to people, look, it doesn't matter.

595
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.160
If you can't remember, if you're,

596
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.080
we let people do the coding interview.

597
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.160
If they're doing the live one or they need to take home one,

598
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.280
or if they're presenting something, it can be any language,

599
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.160
any technology, any platform, whatever tools they want to use.

600
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.040
It's completely up to you. First of all,

601
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.240
I would say pick the language that you're most comfortable

602
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.960
with, not the one that you think will be most impressive

603
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.600
because there isn't one that's most impressive.

604
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.600
It's generally just the one that you're more comfortable

605
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.800
with. But if you say, okay,

606
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.080
I've done JavaScript for 15 years, so let's do JavaScript.

607
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.680
And then all of a sudden in the interview,

608
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.920
you can't remember the name of the function to get the

609
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.720
all the properties and values of an object.

610
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.800
And you have to go to MDN and look it up or Google it.

611
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.280
That's completely okay.

612
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.400
I would say just do that or just ask the interviewer,

613
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.240
do you remember?

614
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.880
And just say, I don't, I've forgotten what this is.

615
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.520
This happens to us all, all the time.

616
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.240
So it's much better to be open and honest.

617
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.760
That brings us to the second common mistake,

618
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.360
which is not admitting when you don't know.

619
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.000
It's too easy to tell when people are bluffing and the

620
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.040
culture we have with our customers is one of radical

621
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.320
transparency.

622
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.800
So our customers trust us and value us more because we don't

623
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.320
try to bluff. We'll quickly admit when we don't know,

624
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.440
and we'll openly admit our mistakes.

625
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.960
And that means that when we say we do know something,

626
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.720
what we say is valued, right?

627
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.240
So I think it's very important when you don't know it in

628
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.800
interview context to say so.

629
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.400
A third one is not asking the interviewer questions.

630
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.600
So if you need clarification, you should ask.

631
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.800
And it's just a good idea in general to show you understand

632
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.400
and collaborate with others by engaging in a proper

633
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.120
conversation. It shouldn't be a one-way quiz.

634
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.400
The last common mistake, you've probably heard it before,

635
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.120
but it's just like basic errors on CVs,

636
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.680
cover letters and emails.

637
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.440
Now we understand that people make typos.

638
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.280
We all make typos and mistakes.

639
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.320
These are all very common,

640
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.920
but a CV is a chance to show you have some pride in the

641
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.200
quality of what you create.

642
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.880
And I think it's quite easy to get it right these days.

643
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.360
I'm kind of amazed sometimes that we get CVs in from a

644
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.440
recruiter and the recruiter hasn't helped the candidate to

645
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.400
improve the quality of the CV as well.

646
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.200
I wonder what value is being added if they're just passing

647
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.080
on the CV exactly as it is.

648
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.080
So please just like get when you're writing a cover letter,

649
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.400
if you get our names right, get our company name right,

650
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.240
get the spell,

651
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.280
the names of the technologies you've worked with correctly.

652
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.160
It's just better.

653
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.360
You're giving people much too easy an opportunity to reject

654
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.400
your application.

655
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.120
If you've got basic mistakes at that stage,

656
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.520
that's the negative side of it over with.

657
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.080
What happens then after the interview Luciano?

658
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.760
I think this part is actually very easy.

659
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.120
We generally have a small group of people that have been

660
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.520
involved in the different stages of the interview.

661
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.600
So what we do is we just have a chat among ourselves to just

662
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.480
get a feeling of what do we want to do with the candidate?

663
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.000
Do we feel comfortable going forward or not?

664
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.360
Also we have been collecting notes throughout all the

665
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.200
different phases.

666
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.200
So we already have a feeling for everyone else's opinion.

667
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.040
So we might just discuss the points where opinions might

668
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.720
differ and decide, okay, well,

669
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.680
let's take a decision together.

670
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.280
So at this point it's more a matter of, it is a yes.

671
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.120
Are we going to make an offer to the candidate or we stop

672
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.720
the interview there and we just give them a rejection.

673
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.720
So depending how it goes, it might be a yes and happy times.

674
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.160
And there is the usual conversation in terms of negotiation

675
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.520
timing and if the candidate accepts the offer is just about

676
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.840
the logistics of getting started.

677
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.800
But if it is a no, what do we do then?

678
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.680
Well, we're always available to give honest feedback to people. Some people want to hear it.

679
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.520
Some people don't, you know, if they don't get the role,

680
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.400
then they're just happy to move on.

681
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.320
And often actually it's not that the candidate isn't great.

682
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.160
They often are great,

683
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.040
but it's just not the right fit at that time.

684
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.920
We're always careful to just kind of think about what they

685
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.320
would do when they come in, who they would be working with.

686
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.200
If you've got the kind of team dynamics, right?

687
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.120
So sometimes it just isn't the right fit at that time.

688
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.080
And maybe you're too experienced or not experienced enough

689
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.480
at the right time.

690
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.840
And sometimes also it's not a no from us,

691
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.920
but a no from a candidate because they don't see it at the

692
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.920
right fit for the right time.

693
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.040
And in both of those cases,

694
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.160
sometimes you just resume the conversation down the line

695
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.000
and the timing is better.

696
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.640
And we have done that in the past and it has worked out

697
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.040
very well.

698
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.640
So I suppose in conclusion,

699
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.360
what can people take from all of this?

700
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.040
Yeah, I think we focused a lot on fourTheorem

701
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.720
and our specific project process,

702
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.240
which is very tailored to our needs and our company culture.

703
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.600
But I think there are some things that you can take away,

704
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.960
either if you're not interested in fourTheorem

705
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.520
as a potential candidate,

706
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.280
or maybe you are hiring people in another company.

707
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.000
So what can you learn from all of this?

708
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.840
What do we think is important?

709
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.000
And if you're hiring,

710
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.400
I think it's important to always make sure that you give

711
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.160
candidates a very clear view of what's the interview

712
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.120
process, what would be the different steps,

713
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.600
what is going to be the timing,

714
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.040
and you share all this information as early as possible,

715
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.240
just to give them a chance to come prepared and try to be,

716
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.800
to be the best version of themselves,

717
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.480
I imagine, for the interview.

718
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.480
It's also important though,

719
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.360
to give them different opportunities for expressing their

720
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.280
skills. Again, talking about technical challenges,

721
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.080
we realize,

722
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.760
and I personally realized that hardcore pair programming is

723
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.600
not for everyone.

724
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.680
Even amazing developers fails them just because there is so

725
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.120
much pressure and they require a specific environment and

726
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.600
not everyone would be comfortable in working in that

727
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.440
environment.

728
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.880
And this environment doesn't really reflect the reality of

729
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.720
the day-to-day job.

730
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.920
So there is also that to keep into account.

731
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.200
So just be aware of that.

732
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.520
And if you feel the candidates have good technical skills,

733
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.800
but they might be afraid of that kind of approach,

734
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.160
try to think about alternatives,

735
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.760
try to figure out what are other ways to assess the

736
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.400
technical skills of that particular candidate.

737
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.040
And I think that kind of leads me to a more generic comment

738
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.160
of just be aware of potential bias.

739
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.760
I think this is more and more important these days.

740
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.840
There will be candidates with all sorts of different

741
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.680
backgrounds,

742
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.520
and that doesn't mean that they cannot contribute to the

743
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.640
company, that they cannot be good candidate,

744
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.240
they cannot contribute to the team.

745
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.040
So try to always assess whether you are projecting some bias

746
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.200
on candidates and try to be honest with yourself and figure

747
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.160
out, am I taking this position because I have a bias,

748
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.040
or maybe there is an actual problem with the person that is

749
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.600
not going to be a fit for this particular role or company.

750
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.360
And I think I personally have to try to do that myself more

751
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.080
because I think there is always some kind of bias that we

752
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.800
kind of underestimate.

753
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.880
So that's probably a suggestion for myself as well.

754
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.560
So on the other side, if you're looking for a new role,

755
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.880
so if you are a potential candidate trying to look for

756
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.240
companies and maybe specifically in the cloud space,

757
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.560
I think there are some generic suggestions that we can take

758
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.640
away from today's chat.

759
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.800
And for sure,

760
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.560
you need to try your best to prepare yourself for the

761
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.400
interview.

762
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.880
Don't just walk in without even thinking about the

763
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720
interview.

764
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720
I think the interview is still important.

765
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.600
You still need to do some preparation.

766
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.880
You still want to do a research on the company.

767
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.200
If it's a technical interview,

768
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.760
maybe there are topics that you want to review because

769
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.600
maybe you know,

770
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.440
you're going to be chatting about cloud architecture.

771
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.080
So do you have some use cases in mind that you can

772
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.320
immediately start to describe and explain when that kind of

773
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.600
question comes up.

774
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.880
So don't, I would say don't underestimate interviews.

775
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.600
Don't just think that if you have been in the industry for

776
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.920
many, many years, by default,

777
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.640
you're just going to shine in an interview.

778
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.960
I think it's still important to do some amount of

779
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.400
preparation.

780
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.680
And when you walk into the interview,

781
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.680
always have a positive attitude, be curious, ask questions,

782
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.160
try to learn as much as possible about the company and the

783
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.280
people that work in that company.

784
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.600
If you are doing something technical and you feel like you

785
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.240
are getting stuck, it's totally fine to ask for help,

786
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.040
to ask for clarifying questions.

787
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.040
Don't try to just come up with the best answer to every

788
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.120
question.

789
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.760
Sometimes the questions are actually strategically created

790
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.520
with some gaps just to see what is your reaction?

791
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.880
Are you going to be asking for clarification or just going

792
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.720
to make a bunch of assumptions around with them?

793
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.480
So just be aware that sometimes it's actually the best

794
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.600
strategy to ask for a question and make sure you really

795
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.920
understand what it is being asked.

796
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.760
And finally,

797
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.160
I would also suggest people to be proud of the work that

798
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.320
they've done so far.

799
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.800
I'm sure that everyone has very interesting stories.

800
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.600
Even if you are a graduate,

801
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.880
probably there are things that you have done through your

802
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.560
journey to get where you are.

803
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.600
And I think you can find ways to highlight where you're

804
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.240
coming from and how you can be valuable for the team or the

805
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.080
company.

806
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.520
So just keep that in mind and use that to also give you an

807
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.800
extra positive attitude.

808
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.080
And I think with that, we are at the end of this episode.

809
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.240
I'm sure that this episode was probably more opinionated

810
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.360
than any other one we've done before.

811
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.280
So I think it's really,

812
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.920
I'm really more excited to hear about your opinion.

813
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.440
If you agree with our approach,

814
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.360
if you do something radically different,

815
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.680
do let us know in the chat,

816
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.040
because I think we can all learn and we can all get better

817
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.640
by sharing the different experiences in this field.

818
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.800
So thank you very much.

819
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:29.800
And we'll see you in the next episode.

820
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.800
Bye.

821
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.800
Bye.
