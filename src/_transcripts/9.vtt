Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of AWS Bites, the weekly show where we answer

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.140
questions about AWS in more or less five minutes.

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.220
My name is Luciano and today I'm joined by Eoin, but before we get started I want to

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.020
ask you to make sure you give us a follow and subscribe so you can be notified every

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.140
time we publish a new episode.

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.100
This question is, how do you get started with AWS?

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.280
It's a very exciting question and I have to thank Adam Mann for suggesting that question

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
on LinkedIn.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.180
So, Eoin, what do you think?

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.520
How would you get started with AWS?

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.880


12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.800
Yeah, well, first things first, I think one of the things you do need to get started with is a credit card.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120
And you know, that's not really great because if you're a student or if you're someone coming

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.360
from a less privileged background, that's not a simple thing to make sure you have.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.840
And then also you need to be aware of your cost because there's no way to cap your cost

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.880
and have guarantees.

17
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.160
So that's the first thing and you need to get that out of the way first because right

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.960
now that is the only way you can get started and create an AWS account.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
What do you think yourself, what would you recommend for somebody who's coming to you

20
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.440
saying, I want to get into AWS, where do I start?

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.600
Yes, I think the problem with AWS is that it's incredibly big.

22
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.960
Like there is so much you could possibly learn that I think it's not humanly possible for

23
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.280
one person to know everything that there is to know in AWS.

24
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.840
So with that being said, of course you need to pick an area of interest.

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.120
So I would probably ask somebody like, what do you already know?

26
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.360
What are your skills that maybe you can learn something in AWS to try to amplify those skills?

27
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.000
And I think that the very common use case that I'm seeing is you maybe are a full stack

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
web developer, you never use AWS, maybe learning how do you deploy a full stack web application

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.160
in AWS can be useful because at that point you are kind of expanding your skills and

30
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.120
also learning how to ship your code to production.

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.720
So that's maybe one angle you could take when approaching AWS.

32
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.360
And yeah, but at the same time, there are maybe things you cannot escape, right?

33
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.200
How do you feel about that?

34
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Yeah.

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Okay.

36
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.000
You've got probably around 200 services.

37
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.800
You have to focus on something.

38
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.340
There's always going to be the fundamental services that you can't escape.

39
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
And while you don't have to learn them completely when you start off, you have to be aware of

40
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480
them.

41
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.440
I am, I am is one of them.

42
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.360
So you need to understand how to manage roles and policies and what the essential details

43
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
are around that.

44
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.440
There can be a lot of complexity to it, but it's good to get started with that pretty

45
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.760
early.

46
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.840
Also understanding users and security and how they relate to roles and policies is important

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.920
because you need to know when you're doing something that isn't secure from the start,

48
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.980
especially when your credit card is behind it again, right?

49
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.680
So IAM is another one.

50
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.140
S3 is a service you probably you're not going to avoid for long.

51
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.860
And it's also quite simple to get started with.

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.760
So much, much more understandable and very useful and broadly, broadly applicable across

53
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.560
lots of different things.

54
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.080
So those are the, those are a couple of fundamentals.

55
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.480
And I'd say that when you're starting to learn about services, there's a couple of different

56
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
ways of doing it.

57
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.900
You can use the web console, the AWS management console.

58
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.960
It's quite a good way to visually create resources and understand how they work.

59
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.640
But I would say as early as possible, you should try and think about getting into creating

60
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.280
resources as code and using infrastructure as code.

61
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.680
So cloud formation or Terraform are good tools for that.

62
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.300
And the reason I'd recommend those, even when you're getting started pretty early on, is

63
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.480
that they're very good for helping you understand how these services are actually configured

64
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.600
under the hood, what their properties are and how they relate to each other.

65
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.780
So it helps you to build a good mental model.

66
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.680
And it's also just a good practice to build up anyway.

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.640
But the other fundamental that of course is important relating to cost is to understand

68
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.520
billing and cost and usage reports, or to have some way of getting insight into your

69
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.140
costs, because it's always something you have to be aware of.

70
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.560
It's a tool you need in your developer toolkit on AWS.

71
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560
What do you think?

72
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920
Have I missed anything there?

73
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.840
I think you gave a pretty comprehensive idea on things you're definitely going to bump

74
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840
into.

75
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.480
So it's better to approach them early and also that they can help you to learn faster

76
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.060
all the different concepts in AWS.

77
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.520
One thing that I want to add is that probably after everything we just said, you still might

78
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.600
not know where to start, because again, it's kind of a jump in the dark.

79
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.960
It's very hard to pick an area and just start.

80
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.840
So if that's the case, I'm going to give you an opinionated recommendation.

81
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.720
Just start with the serverless framework and try to build an API.

82
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.800
There is plenty of tutorials out there.

83
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.440
So just pick whatever seems the most comprehensive or easier to you.

84
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.960
And the interesting thing is that you're probably going to learn about how to build an API,

85
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.240
how to configure API gateway and Lambda and use maybe DynamoDB as a back end to store

86
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.540
the data.

87
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.660
And all these things are core competencies that are going to be very valuable for you.

88
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.400
One reason is because they are very on demand in the market.

89
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.280
They are growing a lot in popularity.

90
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.060
So definitely there is going to be a lot of adoption in the future.

91
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.500
And the other thing is that with those skillset, as somebody that is just studying or maybe

92
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.080
starting to build some products, it's something that can allow you to build different things

93
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.080
very quickly.

94
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.840
So you can easily put things in production without having to learn.

95
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840
I don't know.

96
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.600
How do you manage an EC2 instance or a server?

97
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.080
How do you put those things in production?

98
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.920
How do you maintain them?

99
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.720
You don't need to worry about all this stuff.

100
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.480
You just learn the minimum required to ship code to production and run it, which I think

101
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.000
is something very useful to have in your skillset if you're starting as a web developer especially.

102
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.700
Okay.

103
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.620
So with that being said, I think that's all we have for today.

104
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.180
So thank you very much for listening and definitely let us know what you think in the comments.

105
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.600
If you started using AWS in a different way, we are really curious to know what was your

106
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600
path.

107
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.880
So definitely share that with us.

108
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.200
And if you enjoyed this episode, please give us a thumbs up and remember to follow and

110
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.160
With that, we'll see you next time.

111
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Bye.

112
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:57.040
And we'll see you next time.
