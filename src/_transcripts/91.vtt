00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
We talk with a lot of engineers as part of our job.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.240
And one of the conversations that always pops up is,

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.880
how did we get into software and how did we get into AWS?

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.020
So this is gonna be a very personal episode

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.800
where we share our stories about

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.880
how did we end up in the place where we are today?

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880
And hopefully we'll find that interesting.

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.040
And today maybe we'll share something

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.220
that could be useful for your career as well.

10
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.200
My name is Luciano and today I'm joined by Eoin

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.600
for another episode of AWS Bites podcast.

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.600
AWS Bites is made possible by the support of fourTheorem,

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.840
an AWS consulting partner that works with you

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.960
to make AWS migration, architecture

15
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.560
and development a success.

16
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.720
See fourtheorem.com to find out more.

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.300
Okay Eoin, why don't you go first and tell us the story

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.920
of how did you get into software

19
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.760
and how did you get into AWS?

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.760
Okay, well, how I got into software,

21
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600
I suppose I was lucky in that kind of generation

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.760
and back in that time when kind of cheap home computers

23
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
were becoming possible really on a wide scale.

24
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.160
So the first computer we ever got was a Spectrum ZX,

25
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.760
Sinclair Spectrum ZX.

26
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.520
And this was a very popular in the eighties,

27
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000
kind of I think from the early eighties,

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.520
I think we got one when I was around seven.

29
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.160
And the nice thing about this was

30
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.760
it was a tiny little computer which had like rubber buttons

31
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.480
and you put it into the TV

32
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.260
and it gave you the ability to play games

33
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.560
and also write basic code.

34
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.160
So that was the first language I ever encountered.

35
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.600
And the way you did it back then

36
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.720
was you would go to the news agent

37
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.960
and pick up a magazine for that computer

38
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960
and in it it would have reviews of games

39
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.360
and lots of tips and tricks,

40
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.840
but also code that you could type in into your computer

41
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.200
and you could run games.

42
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
So you got, I suppose I got some exposure then

43
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.360
to what is ultimately imperative programming,

44
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.880
procedural programming, not really until later,

45
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.640
but it was just like simple set of instructions

46
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.540
and coaches mainly.

47
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.560
And I didn't know most of that time

48
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.000
what most of the code meant to be honest,

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880
but it was certainly interesting enough for me

50
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.960
to keep going with it.

51
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.960
And we would then save the code you'd written onto a cassette

52
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.540
so it was actually an audio cassette

53
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
and the Spectrum connected with audio cables.

54
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.840
So it would convert the code to an analog signal

55
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.120
and you could actually hear your code

56
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.440
being saved to the tape.

57
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.360
And then you could play it back.

58
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120
Like you could actually play this back in your stereo

59
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.420
if you wanted, if you really wanted to hurt your ears.

60
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.600
And it wasn't until a good few years later,

61
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.000
like I had a Commodore after that

62
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.560
and much later when I was a teenager, we got a PC.

63
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.940
I think it was like 386, you know?

64
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.400
So these first computers,

65
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.160
I think the Spectrum had 128K of RAM

66
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.260
and then going into computers,

67
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.640
things started to increase pretty quickly then

68
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.080
as they had the exponential growth

69
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080
and Moore's law took off

70
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.340
and processing power and everything increased.

71
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.720
So I was always into computers

72
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.760
and it was pretty obvious that I wanted to study it.

73
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.920
It was really the one thing.

74
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.360
So I was lucky enough to be able to study computer science

75
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.880
for an undergraduate degree in Ireland.

76
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000
At that time, the government had just announced

77
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.620
that they'd pay fees for college students.

78
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.360
So it was possible for everybody.

79
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.000
If you had good enough results, you know, to get in.

80
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.640
Computer science wasn't the top of everybody's list.

81
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.400
So the entry requirements are pretty easy as well.

82
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.940
But my computer science degree was kind of interesting

83
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.100
because it was very broad,

84
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.320
like hardware, software, algorithms,

85
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.000
but also some of the kind of business side as well.

86
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.040
So it was kind of interesting,

87
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.680
although it's very abstract

88
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.080
until you actually start working in it.

89
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.160
So I was able to get some summer jobs in college,

90
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.300
building websites and that kind of thing.

91
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.040
And then once I finished college,

92
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.960
I started working in like telecoms, Java applications

93
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.280
and early distributed applications like Corva systems

94
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.760
and that kind of thing.

95
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.640
Every job I worked in for a couple of years,

96
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
but nice thing about software industry

97
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.840
is that you can move around different industries.

98
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560
Your software skills are always transferable,

99
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.040
but you get to pick up on new domains.

100
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.320
So I was able to work in investment banking

101
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.080
and in kind of service ticketing systems

102
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.020
and also worked in digital TV for a long time,

103
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.240
which was really interesting building kind of like

104
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.280
Netflix type applications.

105
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.600
And that kind of all,

106
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480
most of my career has still been kind of in building

107
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.320
and deploying services onto servers, right?

108
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.180
On premises, in a data center,

109
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.160
running on bare bones instances,

110
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.080
then things move quickly into virtual machines.

111
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.920
And then I suppose it was,

112
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.220
it wasn't like really early adopter to AWS.

113
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.520
I do have an account from when AWS first launched

114
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.440
and I have like a 20 year old API access key.

115
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.460
That's inactive, but it's still there just for like,

116
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.320
it's like a museum piece now.

117
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.120
When AWS first started to emerge,

118
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.280
I don't tend to jump into new technologies very quickly.

119
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.840
I like to see how other people get on with them first

120
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.440
and experience some of the pain before I adopt them.

121
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.800
But it became clear pretty quickly

122
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.860
that AWS is going to be big.

123
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.680
I remember we were talking in a recent episode

124
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.600
about AWS summit in London.

125
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.560
I think I was at one of the first ones in London

126
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.360
when it was basically just in one room in a hotel.

127
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.960
And there was a couple of hundred people there.

128
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.480
And that was, I suppose,

129
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.360
when I really saw how big AWS was going to be.

130
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.720
And then in my subsequent jobs,

131
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.360
I started to do more and more.

132
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.360
And with like a lot of people, it was EC2, S3, SQS,

133
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.040
a lot of stuff in the console at first,

134
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.040
maybe a bit of CloudFront, that kind of thing,

135
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.680
gradually kind of increased my use of AWS over time

136
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.480
and then using containers and then ECS.

137
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.560
And I suppose it's really only at fourth theorem

138
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440
that things have really accelerated

139
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.400
in terms of AWS adoption.

140
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.300
And I think that's all down to, I had a startup,

141
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.800
my own startup, which I was running solo before fourth theorem

142
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.160
and I was then building a lot of product myself

143
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.500
and kind of seeing how business works a lot more

144
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.960
and trying to build things quickly.

145
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.520
And that's when I started to use things

146
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.040
like serverless and Lambda.

147
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.200
So that's like 2016, really.

148
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.040
So it wasn't one of the first adopters of serverless,

149
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.480
but it was early enough, I suppose.

150
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.120
And I saw what a difference it could make

151
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.120
if you really started to use these managed services

152
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.920
and how quickly you could do stuff.

153
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.720
And that was kind of the philosophy we started

154
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.800
with in fourth theorem as well,

155
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.080
and always trying to make things easier for everybody.

156
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.800
And I think that's more or less in summary,

157
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.160
my journey to AWS.

158
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.600
Have I missed anything?

159
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.440
That's pretty good.

160
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.800
Lots of stuff I didn't know about you.

161
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.760
So I'm glad you shared this.

162
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.080
Yeah, I don't know if it's too secret,

163
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.760
but happy to share it anyway.

164
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.120
So I started with my first computer

165
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.120
when I was, I think about 12 years old.

166
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.360
And I was always fascinated by computers,

167
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.480
but just even when I was even younger than that,

168
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.000
because I had people in my family working with computers

169
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.400
and I always thought they were a bit of a magic thing.

170
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.200
And I knew eventually I would want to work with one as well.

171
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.960
And at some point, I think when I was 12,

172
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.260
I got lucky that my father was,

173
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.280
he owned like a kind of a warehouse business.

174
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.120
And that business basically went bad.

175
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.760
They were dismissing everything.

176
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.200
And as a result of that, I got a very old i386,

177
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.960
I think it was, which just landed on my desk.

178
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.160
And that was the computer that they used

179
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.380
to kind of track the inventory of this place.

180
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.080
And the only thing that was installed in that computer

181
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.120
was MS-DOS.

182
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.680
So I kind of didn't know anything.

183
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.960
I just turned it on and I found this problem.

184
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.520
It's like, what do I do now?

185
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.520
And I don't even remember how eventually

186
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.360
I got into the kind of basic commands

187
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.800
and figured out, OK, what are directories?

188
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.200
You can create files.

189
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.080
And then I discovered that there were only two applications

190
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.400
running in that machine, what installed in that machine.

191
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.480
One was a chess game, which was actually quite nice.

192
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.560
So I spent a lot of time playing chess in that machine.

193
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.240
And the other one was another software

194
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.200
called Banner, which was basically

195
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.440
some kind of word art.

196
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.120
I would describe it that way.

197
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.600
Like you can design effectively, like, I don't know,

198
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.640
text in a bunch of different shapes and print it.

199
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.200
That was it.

200
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.760
I didn't even have a printer, so it was just fun to design it.

201
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.080
But then I couldn't print it.

202
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.240
And for a long time, these were the only two things

203
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.960
that I was doing with that machine,

204
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.120
until at one point in a school textbook,

205
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.040
I found out that there was an addendum at the end saying,

206
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.280
oh, there is this thing called programming languages

207
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.120
that you can use to teach the computer to do things, things

208
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.080
that you want to automate somehow.

209
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.440
And then it was explaining something about basic.

210
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.400
And I actually went back to the prompt and typed QBasic.

211
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.320
And I realized, OK, I also have this thing,

212
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.800
so I can do this thing.

213
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.040
And I was basically copy pasting manually examples from the book

214
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.760
into my own QBasic interpreter and running them.

215
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.760
But it was as simple as drawing like a Christmas tree

216
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.760
or playing some tunes with the 8-bit tunes,

217
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.040
or maybe just printing text and doing

218
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.400
kind of form-like application where you would ask,

219
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.720
I don't know, give me the input for this,

220
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.200
give me the input for that, and then do some calculation

221
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.480
as a result. So for a long time, this

222
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.040
was the only type of programming that I did.

223
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.200
And I didn't even understand for loops.

224
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.400
So everything was basically like extremely procedural step

225
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.000
by step.

226
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.160
But it was super fun nonetheless.

227
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.360
Can I interrupt you?

228
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.440
Did you play Gorillas?

229
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.360
Do you remember that?

230
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.000
I think QBasic also came with Gorillaz.

231
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.720
It was like GORILLAS.BAS.

232
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.840
I don't know that one.

233
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.320
OK, well, maybe it would have sucked up all your time

234
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.720
and you never would have got into programming

235
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.680
if you discovered it.

236
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.800
I think it came with another one as well called Nibbles.

237
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.720
It was like a snake kind of game.

238
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.600
Yeah, I digress.

239
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.960
I'm just reminiscing.

240
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.640
OK, I didn't know this one.

241
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.520
So now I want to search for a QBasic interpreter

242
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.400
and play with these ones.

243
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.400
So yeah, long story short, after that, I

244
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.640
knew I would be spending more and more time learning more

245
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.840
about programming.

246
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.720
And during high school, I was lucky enough

247
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.080
to get an actual pendulum with Windows 95

248
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.280
and a proper desktop environment.

249
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.840
And I remember FrontPage and Dreamweaver

250
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.320
and getting into web programming and doing all this kind

251
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.160
of stuff, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

252
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.680
And basically throughout high school,

253
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.080
I ended up building websites for friends and family,

254
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.440
sometimes actually getting paid for it, which was nice.

255
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440
But you can imagine how little you

256
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.000
would get paid for that kind of stuff,

257
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.080
even though it would take maybe your entire summer

258
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.720
to build a website.

259
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.520
But it was fun, and I did learn a lot.

260
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.520
And then I was also lucky enough to be

261
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.600
able to go to the university to study computer science,

262
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.760
did a bachelor degree first, and then a master degree a bit

263
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.600
later.

264
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.680
And also through that time, I did some work experience,

265
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.800
actually working for a couple of companies,

266
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.040
doing kind of my own startup.

267
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.640
And eventually, after all of that, I moved to Ireland,

268
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.760
and I did more jobs still in the space of full stack web

269
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.840
development.

270
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.560
And funny enough, I ended up working

271
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.680
in projects where the idea was more and more

272
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.760
to go to the cloud, while in the company

273
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.960
there was no expertise to do that.

274
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.800
And it was a great position to be in,

275
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.840
because that meant that I was part directly, even though I

276
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.480
was hired to build the application as a full stack

277
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.200
developer.

278
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.960
I needed to figure out, OK, how do we bring this to the cloud?

279
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.640
What do we need to learn to be able to be

280
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.120
successful in the cloud?

281
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.920
And of course, I was not doing that alone,

282
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.840
but I was part of a team where everyone was learning together.

283
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.160
And that was my first time getting exposed to AWS.

284
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.760
Funny enough, initially, it was lots of serverless stuff,

285
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.280
because this was around, I think, 2016.

286
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.240
So I think we were among the first companies trying

287
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.120
to build an entire product with serverless, which

288
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.200
was a lot of rough edges, like lots of limitations with Lambda.

289
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.760
It wasn't definitely at the level it is today.

290
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.480
But nonetheless, it was really interesting.

291
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.400
And I remember we even did a few talks with AWS itself,

292
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.160
presenting that particular project.

293
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.320
So it was quite successful, even though the company eventually

294
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:55.920
shut down.

295
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.120
So none of this is still running in production today.

296
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.720
Was it this early exposure to serverless that led to you building Middy for the first time?

297
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.680
Was it because you were involved in the early days?

298
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.480
That's a very good point, yes.

299
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.600
So basically, we did all the usual mistakes

300
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.360
that I think most people will do when

301
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.200
they start using serverless.

302
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.360
It feels like you are doing microservices++,

303
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.680
and you end up treating every Lambda as its own repository,

304
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.920
project, and code base totally isolated from everything else.

305
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.120
Even though logically, maybe you have two Lambdas that

306
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.760
are part of the same service, we were splitting everything

307
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.560
to the most granular level.

308
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.160
And then we realized, OK, the amount of code duplication

309
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.640
is insane.

310
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.240
So we built this kind of internal framework

311
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.520
to try to reduce that code duplication by applying

312
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.560
the middleware pattern.

313
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.200
And then when the company was shut down,

314
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.440
we took that and open-sourced as Middy.

315
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.360
So that's actually a very good point.

316
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.120
My first exposure to AWS very early on

317
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.560
highlighted the need for that particular tool.

318
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.680
And I was lucky enough to be working

319
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.640
in a team that was willing to invest in creating that tool.

320
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.400
And then they gave me freedom to keep working

321
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.840
on that and open-source it.

322
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.480
So after that, I was working in a couple of other companies

323
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.120
where I was still part of cloud-heavy projects.

324
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.120
But at the same time, again, teams

325
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.600
that were a bit on the forefront in the company trying

326
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.760
to figure out how do we bring something to the cloud when we

327
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.840
don't really have a lot of knowledge in the company

328
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.640
about deploying stuff in the cloud.

329
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.040
So again, I needed to roll up my sleeves and figure it out,

330
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.640
OK, how do we do this and that?

331
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.360
And in the other company, it wasn't as much serverless.

332
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.400
It was actually running big cluster of EC2 machines

333
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.640
with Elasticsearch.

334
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.800
So that is where I learned a lot the value

335
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.480
of doing infrastructure as code, learning very well

336
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.240
all the networking stuff, figuring out

337
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.520
how to implement auto-scaling, and lots of more hardcore

338
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.840
skills that are very useful in the cloud.

339
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.120
And I think those are, in many cases,

340
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.680
the reasons why you see a lot of value going into the cloud.

341
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.240
Because of course, you can run your own servers anywhere.

342
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.880
But if you don't use a cloud provider like AWS,

343
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.720
you don't always get a simple way to automatically scale

344
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.680
and do big deployments of big clusters

345
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.920
that can scale elastically.

346
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.760
And I think after that, there was another experience that

347
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.880
was somewhat similar, more in the space of e-commerce,

348
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.640
so trying to optimize running e-commerce services online,

349
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.920
still using AWS.

350
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.520
And then after that, I joined Fortier.

351
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.640
And for me, Fortier was as well a big accelerator into,

352
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.520
let's try to become, as professional career experts

353
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.120
in AWS, so let's try to get certified.

354
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.160
Let's try to learn more about AWS architecture,

355
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.920
different applications of building stuff on AWS,

356
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.720
for different markets, different industries.

357
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.840
So that's a journey that has been going on for me

358
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.080
for two years and a half.

359
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.960
And I think I've been learning a lot more about AWS

360
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.600
and feel that I'm still probably 10% of, maybe less,

361
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.600
of what there is to know about AWS.

362
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.360
But I'm feeling now I have a much more complete overview

363
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.320
on what's possible with AWS.

364
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.840
We both have, I suppose, a kind of a traditional form

365
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.360
of education in computer science.

366
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.080
And that led to a career in it.

367
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.320
I'm interested in a couple of things.

368
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.320
One is, if you had been learning software

369
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.200
for the first time in this age,

370
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.840
when all the information is available

371
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.440
and you've got LLMs to help you,

372
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.680
and you've got massive amounts of educational resources,

373
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.760
how different would it be?

374
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.760
And the other question is,

375
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.640
is this representative of what you need to do

376
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.920
to get into the cloud?

377
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.200
I mean, I would say not.

378
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.040
In our last episode about interviewing for jobs in AWS,

379
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.640
we talked about like a computer science degree

380
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.760
definitely not being a hard requirement.

381
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.120
We are interested in people

382
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.920
from lots of different backgrounds.

383
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.560
How do you think it's different, I guess,

384
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.240
for people getting into the cloud these days?

385
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.160
Yeah, I guess for me, it's also interesting

386
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.360
that I had my education in Italy

387
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.840
where there is a very common complaint,

388
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.280
for better or worse,

389
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.040
that education is very theoretical

390
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.280
and there is very little practice,

391
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.160
which is something that I didn't appreciate at the time.

392
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.760
I think I'm starting to appreciate a lot more now

393
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.640
that I'm feeling the practical gaps

394
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.680
and realizing how much effort was put into the theory

395
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.840
that I have a lot of ground already covered

396
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.880
and then I can easily build the experience part.

397
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.720
But at the same time,

398
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.680
I wish that when I came out of the university,

399
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.080
that I was more ready to go on the job.

400
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.480
And I think if I was,

401
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.760
was only because I did a lot of stuff on the side on my own,

402
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.440
trying to work even just with friends and family

403
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.120
building things for them.

404
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.320
I managed to fill that gap

405
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.400
a little bit into the practical knowledge.

406
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.000
So I don't know if that's representative for kind of career

407
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.600
and studies everywhere else.

408
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
I know that for instance,

409
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.720
talking with people in Ireland,

410
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.240
in Ireland there is a good amount of practice.

411
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.680
So maybe it will be very different

412
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.520
depending where you get your degree,

413
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.680
what kind of knowledge you come out with.

414
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.960
So I don't know how to answer the first question

415
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.440
if it will be very different.

416
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.600
I think it's already very different

417
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.000
depending where you study

418
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.800
and exactly the curriculum that you follow

419
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.640
and the professors that you have.

420
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.520
And I don't know, the type of exams,

421
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.120
if they tend to be more or less practical.

422
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.480
So I don't know, I think today it is true

423
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.560
that there is a lot more material

424
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.720
and sometimes it's nice that you can learn things

425
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.920
very, very quickly.

426
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.240
Like, I don't know, I remember every topic

427
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240
I did at the university,

428
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.040
you had like these massive books

429
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.000
that were like 500 pages each

430
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.680
and you were supposed to study all of them

431
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.160
and do the exam in like a month

432
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
because if you needed to do 10 of those exams in a year,

433
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.880
that's the time you have.

434
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.480
And basically you were always trying to optimize,

435
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.360
like how do I summarize this entire book?

436
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.480
What are some notes that I can use?

437
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.240
Can I use some slides from the professor?

438
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.480
So you were always finding shortcuts anyway.

439
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.160
I think today's just gonna be easier

440
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.360
to find those shortcuts

441
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.880
and try to optimize for effectively the time that you have.

442
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.480
Like you cannot possibly read 500,

443
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.240
read, understand and memorize 500 pages

444
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.400
of technical content in a month

445
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.240
for every single subject that you have to do

446
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.280
at the universe.

447
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880
If you were 12 years old, again, I often ask this question to myself

448
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.640
and we had access to everything that internet is today

449
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.640
and the devices that we have today.

450
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.560
Would you use the opportunity at that age

451
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.840
to absorb a lot of knowledge

452
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.840
and to really accelerate your learning

453
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.520
around programming and technology

454
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.040
or would you blow it all on TikTok and online gaming?

455
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.880
Yeah, I don't know.

456
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.960
I guess in my personal case,

457
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.560
I was having fun trying to literally,

458
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.400
that feeling of I can teach something to the computer

459
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.960
and I can tweak it and I can try different things.

460
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.920
So it was kind of a game for me.

461
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.880
So I think that gamification part

462
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.280
was very fundamental for me

463
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.000
to pave that path into computer science.

464
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.440
But I guess if you are missing that fun element

465
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.080
then you are only forcing yourself to do it

466
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.720
because you think you're gonna have a career in the future.

467
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.560
I don't know.

468
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.200
I don't think it's gonna work out for people at that age.

469
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.600
I think you need to be fun.

470
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.240
So maybe there are things today

471
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.880
that are more gamified for people

472
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.440
that might want to start to lay down that path at that age

473
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.800
but it still needs to be mostly a game

474
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.400
because otherwise, I mean, you're still going to school,

475
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.040
you're still studying a lot of things,

476
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.160
you cannot possibly study something

477
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.320
just because you're gonna need it

478
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.520
at least in 10 years time if not more.

479
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.920
The number of kind of younger people of that age, like kids getting into code for the fun of it

480
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.360
must be lower these days

481
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.360
because back when we were writing basic programs,

482
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.400
the stuff you were doing was as compelling

483
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.000
as the applications that were available

484
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.280
because the applications were available

485
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.680
were not that sophisticated.

486
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.800
Whereas now the applications that are available

487
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.840
to everybody on laptops and smartphones

488
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.920
are way more sophisticated than anything you can do

489
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.440
when you're just beginning to write programming.

490
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.200
So it could become frustrating more early

491
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.800
but I think it just means

492
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.800
that people will take a different path into it.

493
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.960
It won't all be about the code first.

494
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.760
The availability of knowledge and information

495
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.160
makes people much savvier and much more rounded early on.

496
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.840
So maybe the coding part is something that will come later

497
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.800
or become less relevant.

498
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.000
Yeah, I think that the meat of all the digital natives

499
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.400
are automatically skilled with computers

500
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.680
is definitely proving not to be true.

501
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.600
So this is definitely an interesting question

502
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.760
that we should ask ourselves.

503
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.840
I'm finding that a lot of the younger generations

504
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.520
you give for granted that they understand our computer work

505
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.880
but that's definitely not a given.

506
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.480
If they don't actually study for it,

507
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.440
they have no idea it's just another magic box.

508
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.720
So maybe that's another interesting element

509
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.520
of the education system where there is more that can be done

510
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.440
at least to try to give some of the basic knowledge

511
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.600
on how to use a computer,

512
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.880
understanding how it works and what's possible with it

513
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.880
even though you might not want to pursue

514
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.560
a technology or computer science type of career.

515
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.640
Yeah, I think at least it's good to see that now instead of like schools are adding programming skills

516
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.560
or IT skills into secondary school curricula

517
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.920
and now into also primary school.

518
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.840
So from a very young age,

519
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.960
I think this is gonna take time to develop

520
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.200
but it does give hope that we'll have new generations

521
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.920
of developers coming in with just a different path to it

522
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.320
but just a new perspective

523
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.760
that will ultimately improve things for everyone.

524
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.200
Okay, so I think that was a very good conversation

525
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.680
on I don't know, at least discover a bit more

526
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.520
about ourselves.

527
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.000
I hope that was also interesting for people listening.

528
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.520
I would be really good as to know more

529
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.760
about the people listening.

530
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.440
How did you start if you were happy with your path,

531
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.520
if you think you did some early mistake

532
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.440
or maybe something you would have done differently

533
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.040
given the chance that you could go back

534
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.720
and try something different.

535
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720
So please share those kinds of stories

536
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.640
because I think everyone has a different path

537
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.960
and lots of people starting this path now,

538
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.040
they can take inspiration from what people have been doing

539
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.240
to get to the point where they are today.

540
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.520
So use the comments below if you are on YouTube

or reach out to us on Twitter

542
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.240
and share your personal experience

543
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.640
if you want to keep it private.

544
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.320
We still love to have a private chat

545
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.800
so reach out to our direct message and we'll talk there.

546
