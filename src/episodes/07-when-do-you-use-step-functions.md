In this episode Eoin and Luciano try to reply to a question suggested by <a href="https://twitter.com/em__shea">Emily Shea</a>: When do you use Step Functions?

Our answer describes what Step Function is and what you can build with it. We discuss some examples of features that we built in the past using step functions (a billing engine and a crawler) and why. We also discuss what are the main advantages of Step Functions and some things to be aware of, including limitations, cost and when not to use Step Functions.
