In this episode, Eoin and Luciano try to answer a beginner question: how to get started with AWS. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-e-mann/">Adam Mann</a> for suggesting this question!
     
AWS is so big that it doesn’t make any sense to try to learn it all! It’s better to learn the fundamentals and then focus on specific areas of interest to get the best out of AWS.

But what are these fundamentals and where do I start if I have a background as a web developer? Check out this episode to find out!
