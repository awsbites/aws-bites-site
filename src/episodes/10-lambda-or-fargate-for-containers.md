In this episode, Eoin and Luciano try to explain whether you should consider Lambda or Fargate for containers.

We start by clarifying what we really mean by containers and what kind of container support you get in both Lambda and Fargate. Then we go into more detail about the characteristics of both services including limits and pricing. By the end of this episode you should be able to understand how the two services compare and which one might be more suitable for your next project!
