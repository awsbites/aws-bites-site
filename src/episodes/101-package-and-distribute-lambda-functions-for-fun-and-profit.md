Today we embark on a fascinating journey into the world of AWS Lambda functions and how to make them accessible to the public. In a recent use case, involving the creation of a public Lambda function for AWS users, we asked ourselves some interesting questions. How can you securely, cost-effectively, and conveniently publish AWS resources, especially Lambda functions, for others to use? And... can we possibly make some money out of this?

Join us as we explore various options and share our findings for making your AWS resources available to the world. We dive into the Serverless Application Repository (SAR), an AWS treasure trove for publishing resources. And SAR isn't the only way! We also discuss alternatives like CloudFormation templates, GitHub publishing, Terraform modules, and container images. We explore the pros and cons of these methods and debate the implications in terms of cost, security, and ease of use. Finally, we touch on the AWS Marketplace as a platform to monetize your AWS resources.
