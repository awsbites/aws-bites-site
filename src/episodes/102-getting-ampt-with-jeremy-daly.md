In this episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Jeremy Daly, CEO of Ampt and a leader in the AWS and serverless community. We discuss Jeremy's journey into AWS and serverless, the prolific open source work and content he creates, the evolution of serverless over the years, common myths about serverless, and, finally, the story behind building Ampt to improve the developer experience. Jeremy provides his perspective on the state of serverless and predictions for the future and it also gives some fantastic pieces of advice for wannabe tech-entrepreneurs!
