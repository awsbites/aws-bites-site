In this episode, Luciano and Eoin discuss the good and the bad of the AWS Management Console (a.k.a. the web console) and why you should consider migrating to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as soon as possible, especially for your production applications.

In this episode we mentioned the following resources:

  - [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) 
  - [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
