In this episode, we discuss how we work as a cloud consulting company, including our principles, engagement process, sprint methodology, and focus on agile development to deliver successful projects. We aim to be trusted partners, not just vendors, and enable our customers' business goals.

By the end of this episode, you will know what working with a cloud consulting company like fourTheorem could look like and you might learn some strategies to make cloud projects a success! We will also digress a little into the history of software practices, common misconceptions, and what we believe should be the right way to build software.
