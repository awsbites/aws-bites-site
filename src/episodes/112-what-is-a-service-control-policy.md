In this episode, we provide a friendly introduction to Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations. We explain what SCPs are, how they work, common use cases, and tips for troubleshooting access-denied errors related to SCPs. We cover how SCPs differ from identity-based and resource-based policies, and how SCPs can be used to set boundaries on maximum permissions in AWS accounts across an organization.

> AWS Bites is sponsored by fourTheorem, an AWS Partner with plenty of experience setting up AWS accounts and Service Control Policies. If that's something you'd like some help with, reach out to us on social media or check out [fourtheorem.com](https://fourtheorem.com)!
