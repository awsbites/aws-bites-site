In this episode, we discuss Permission Boundary policies in AWS IAM. A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. When you set a permissions boundary for an entity, the entity can perform only the actions allowed by its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
In this episode, we discuss this concept a bit more in detail and we show how it can be used to give freedom to development teams while preventing privilege escalation. We also cover some of the disadvantages that come with using permission boundaries and other things to be aware of. Finally, we will give some practical advice on how to get the best out of Permissions Boundary Policy and get the best out of them.
