In this episode, we discuss best practices for working with AWS Lambda. We cover how Lambda functions work under the hood, including cold starts and warm starts. We then explore different invocation types - synchronous, asynchronous, and event-based. For each, we share tips on performance, cost optimization, and monitoring. Other topics include function structure, logging, instrumentation, and security. Throughout the episode, we aim to provide a solid mental model for serverless development and share our experiences to help you build efficient and robust Lambda applications.


> AWS Bites is brought to you by fourTheorem, an AWS Partner that specialises in modern application architecture and migration. We are big fans of serverless and we have worked on quite a few serverless projects even at a massive scale!
