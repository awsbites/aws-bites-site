In this episode, we discuss Luciano's new book project on using Rust to write
AWS Lambda functions. We start with a recap on why Rust is a good fit for
Lambda, including performance, efficiency, safety, and low cold start times.
Luciano provides details on the book's progress so far, the intended audience,
and the current published chapters covering Lambda internals, getting started
with Rust Lambda, and building a URL shortener app with DynamoDB. We also
explore the differences between traditional publishing and self-publishing, and
why Luciano chose the self-publishing route for this book. Luciano shares
insights into the writing process with AsciiDoc, code samples, SVG image
generation, and using Gumroad for distribution. He invites feedback from
listeners who have experience with Rust and Lambda.
