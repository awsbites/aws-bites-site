In this episode, we had the pleasure to interview Farah Campbell, head of modern
compute community at AWS, prolific speaker, and former AWS Hero. We discussed
Farah's career journey from healthcare into tech, tips on public speaking,
dealing with imposter syndrome, the pace of innovation in the cloud, and
predictions for the future. Farah shared personal stories and advice for getting
started in tech and being an active member of the community. It was inspiring to
hear from someone so passionate about helping others learn and grow.
