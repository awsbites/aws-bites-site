In this episode, we discuss the concept of CloudFormation drift, what causes it,
how to detect it, and strategies for resolving it. We explain that drift happens
when the actual state of resources diverges from what is defined in the
CloudFormation templates. Common causes include manual changes, third party
tools, mixing IaC solutions, and automation. We then cover built-in drift
detection in CloudFormation and integrating it with alarms. Finally, we suggest
approaches for reconciling drift like change sets, deletion protection, and
bringing up parallel stacks.
