In this episode, we discuss why IAM users and long-lived credentials are
dangerous and should be avoided. We share war stories of compromised credentials
and overprivileged access. We then explore solutions like centralizing IAM
users, using tools like AWS Vault for temporary credentials, integrating with
AWS SSO, and fully eliminating IAM users when possible.
