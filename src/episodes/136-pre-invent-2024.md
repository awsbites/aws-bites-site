In this pre-re:Invent 2024 episode, Luciano and Eoin discuss some of their
favorite recent AWS announcements, including improvements to AWS Step Functions,
Lambda runtime updates, DynamoDB price reductions, ALB header injection, Cognito
enhancements, VPC public access blocking, and more. They share their thoughts on
the implications of these new capabilities and look forward to seeing what else
is announced at the conference. Overall, it's an exciting time for AWS
developers with many new features to explore. Very important: no focus on GenAI
in this episode :)
