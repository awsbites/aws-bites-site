In this episode, David Lynam provides an overview of AWS Transit Gateway, which aims to simplify complex network connectivity between VPCs, VPNs, and on-premises networks. We discuss the limitations of using VPC peering and the benefits Transit Gateway provides through its hub-and-spoke model. The main components of Transit Gateway are explained, including attachments, route tables, associations, and route propagation. We go through some example use cases like sharing Transit Gateways across accounts, network isolation for compliance, routing traffic through security services, and bandwidth/scaling capabilities.
