In this episode, we provide an overview of AWS Step Functions and dive deep into
the powerful new JSONata and variables features. We explain how JSONata allows
complex JSON transformations without custom Lambda functions, enabling more
serverless workflows. The variables feature also helps avoid the previous 256KB
state size limit. We share examples from real projects showing how these
features simplify workflows, reduce costs and enable new use cases.
