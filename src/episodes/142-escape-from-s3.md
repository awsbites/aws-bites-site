We discuss common use cases and challenges for copying data between S3 buckets
and S3-compatible object storage services. We share our experience building an
open source Node.js CLI tool called S3-Migrate to efficiently migrate data with
separate source and destination credentials. We cover performance considerations
like streaming, chunk sizes, concurrency and parallelism.
