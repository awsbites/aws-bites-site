Amazon Aurora DSQL promises to bring a truly serverless experience to SQL
databases. But does it actually deliver? In this episode of AWS Bites, we put
Aurora DSQL to the test. We explore what makes it exciting, how it compares to
traditional Aurora Serverless, and where it falls short. You’ll hear what
changed since our last Aurora deep dive, and why DSQL might be the
PostgreSQL-compatible serverless database you’ve been waiting for.
