What if AWS had its own version of Killed by Google? Well… turns out it kind of
does.

In this episode of AWS Bites, we explore the AWS Product Lifecycle page, the
official place where AWS quietly lists products and services that are being
deprecated, shut down, or closed to new customers. If you rely on AWS in
production, this is a page you’ll want to bookmark.

We walk through what’s on the list today, from Amazon Pinpoint to IoT Analytics
and beyond, and we even throw in some predictions of what might be next to hit
the chopping block. App Runner vs Beanstalk? API Gateway REST vs HTTP? Let the
speculation begin!
