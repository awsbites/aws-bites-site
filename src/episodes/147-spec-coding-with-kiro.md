What if AWS built an IDE to rival your favorite editor? Turns out they did!

In this episode of AWS Bites, we dive into Kiro, an AI centric fork of VS Code that tries to turn an empty repo and a loose idea into working software. Kiro imports your VS Code world, then guides you through requirements, design, and a clear task plan before an agent gets to work. We share what clicked, what tripped us up, and how Kiro’s spec driven approach compares to Cursor or Claude Code. We also cover status, limits, pricing, and what this could become if AWS leans in with deep cloud integration. Stick around for our take on whether you should switch or wait.
