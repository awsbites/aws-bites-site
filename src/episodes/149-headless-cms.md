We dive deep into Strapi, an open-source headless CMS that's changing how we approach content management and CRUD applications. In this episode, we explore how Strapi separates content from presentation, allowing marketing teams to manage content independently while developers maintain full control over the frontend experience. We discuss the powerful features that caught our attention, including the visual content type builder, dynamic zones, components, and the innovative blocks editor that stores content as JSON rather than HTML. We also cover practical aspects like local development workflows, data synchronization between environments, and deployment strategies on AWS. While we highlight some rough edges around documentation and minor bugs, we share our overall positive experience and provide insights into when Strapi might be the right choice for your next project.
