In this extended episode, Luciano and Eoin try to cover a recurring topic around Serverless: is it a good or bad idea for startups?

We start by giving a brief description of the different definitions and perspectives on serverless. Then, we try to explore some cases in which we believe serverless might not be the best fit for a startup. We follow on by revisiting some cases where instead we believe serverless can actually be a great fit. We finish by discussing some suggestions on how a startup (or even a more established company) could start approaching serverless in a more cautious and incremental way.
