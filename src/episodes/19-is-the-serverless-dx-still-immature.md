In this episode of AWS Bites podcast, Luciano and Eoin talk about what the serverless Developer Experience (DX) is like and whether we should consider it still immature or not.

In this context we discuss some of the struggles with local development, what are some tools that can make our lives easier and how we can improve the overall serverless experience.
