Luciano and Eoin take a deep dive into SQS as part of a series on AWS event services and event-driven architecture. We talk about the kind of problems SQS can solve, all of the SQS features and how to configure and use SQS to achieve reliability and scalability without all the complexity. We also take some time to detail how SQS works with Lambda in terms of scaling, batching and filtering.
 
In this episode we mentioned the following resources:

  - [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) 
  - [Using Lambda with SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)
  - [Lambda SQS Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-sqs-scaling/)
