      Eoin and Luciano continue their series about event services. In this episode, they chat about EventBridge and explore why this AWS service has such a great potential for event-based serverless applications. This episode presents some interesting examples of when and how to use EventBridge. It also covers all the different classes of events that you can manage with EventBridge: AWS events, third-party events and custom events. We discuss limits and pricing and, finally, we show how things can go wrong and how much you can end up paying for it. We conclude the episode with some tips and resources to avoid shooting yourself in the foot and get good observability when using EventBridge.
