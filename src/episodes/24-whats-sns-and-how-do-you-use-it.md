Luciano and Eoin deep dive into SNS discussing what it does, how it differs from EventBridge and SQS and how you can use it to send messages to customers but also for microservices communication. In this new episode dedicated to AWS events and messaging services, we learn everything there is to know about SNS including advantages, limitations and cost. This episode complements the episode about EventBridge, giving another perspective on when to use SNS and when to pick EventBridge instead.
