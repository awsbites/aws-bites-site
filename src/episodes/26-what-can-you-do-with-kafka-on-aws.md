Luciano and Eoin explore the wonderful world of data streaming using Kafka on AWS. In this episode we focus mainly on Managed Streaming for Kafka (or MSK) and discuss what are the main differences between MSK and Kinesis. We also explore the main features that MSK provides, its scaling characteristics, pricing and, finally, how MSK works in conjunction with other AWS services.

We conclude the episode by providing a decision tree that should help you to decide whether you should use Kinesis or MSK or avoid streaming services entirely in favor of something like SNS or SQS.
