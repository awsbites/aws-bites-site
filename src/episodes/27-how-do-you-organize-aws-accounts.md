Eoin and Luciano try to answer the question of what AWS accounts do you need for your team and how to organize them. In this episode of AWS bites we discuss common ways to organize AWS accounts and environments from the perspective of a company running production workloads. We try to answer questions like “how many accounts and how many environments?”. We also discuss how you and your team can be more productive by effectively managing AWS accounts and environments. Finally we explore some common security and cost-related tradeoffs that are common when it comes to organizing AWS accounts.

Thanks to David Lynam for suggesting this awesome topic!
