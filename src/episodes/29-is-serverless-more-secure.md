Eoin and Luciano take you through the ways serverless can give you more security out of the box. We cover the tradeoffs between having more security control and the responsibility that comes with this power. There are always new security challenges so we cover some of the common pitfalls with serverless and AWS security in general. Finally, we share some tips to make your serverless deployments more secure.
