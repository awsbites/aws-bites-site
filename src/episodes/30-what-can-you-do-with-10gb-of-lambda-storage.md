AWS Lambda just got a big upgrade in ephemeral storage: you can now have up to 10 GB of storage for your /tmp folder! Before this was limited to “only” 512 Mb… But is this really useful? What can we do now that we couldn’t do before? Also, is this going to have an impact on price? And how does it compare with other storage capabilities that are available in Lambda? Eoin and Luciano are on the case to try to find some answers to these compelling questions, for the greater serverless good!
