      Should I use CloudFormation or should I use Terraform instead? If you are just starting to write Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) you probably have this question. In this episode, we will discuss in detail how these two amazing pieces of technology compare against each other and what their features, weaknesses and strengths are. We will share our opinions based on our experience with these 2 technologies and guess what, for once we have a bit of clash of opinions! Can you guess who is in the Terraform camp and who is in the CloudFormation camp instead?
