The public cloud gives you amazing machine learning powers with a low barrier to entry. Once you know where to begin, you can quickly build solutions to process images, video, text and audio, as well as structured data. In this episode we talk about the managed AI services that are available on AWS and that require zero machine learning expertise (Rekognition, Polly, Transcribe, Forecast, Personalise, Comprehend, Lex, Textract, Translate). We will also talk about services you can use to create and run your own custom models (SageMaker). We will finally cover some different use cases and some of the things you need to consider before you do machine learning in production.
