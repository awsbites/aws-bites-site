In this special episode, we announce our next initiative: starting some YouTube coding live streams where we build something on AWS. Specifically, we are going to build a file transfer service, just like WeTransfer or Dropbox Transfer! In this episode, we announce why we decided to start this, the logistics, and some of the details of the product we are going to build.
We are really looking forward to pairing with you all live on this build! Make sure you are subscribed to our YouTube channel so you are notified when we go live on Wednesday 17 August!

In this episode, we mentioned the following resources:
