How can you build a WeTransfer or a Dropbox Transfer clone on AWS?

This is our third live coding stream. In this episode, we made our lambdas better by adding observability best practices (structured logs, metrics and tracing) through Lambda Power Tools for TypeScript and Middy. We also created a simple Node.js CLI to easily upload files from the command line.

All our code is available in this repository: [github.com/awsbites/weshare.click](https://github.com/awsbites/weshare.click).


Some of the resources we mentioned:
