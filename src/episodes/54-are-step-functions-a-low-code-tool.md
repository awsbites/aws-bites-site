AWS Step Functions are all the rage right now! The visual editor is getting better and better and there are always new capabilities like the recently introduced intrinsic functions. In this episode we will try to answer the question “are Step Functions a Low-Code tool”? In the process, we will give our own definition of what Low-Code means, and we will describe the main characteristics of Step Functions and try to assess whether they match our definition or not. We will also discuss several practical use cases that can be addressed with Low-Code and Step Functions.
