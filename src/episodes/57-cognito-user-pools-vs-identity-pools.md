If you looked into Cognito, chances are that you have been confused by User Pools and Identity Pools (now renamed to Federated Identities). Well, Cognito is not one of the simplest AWS services to get started with but it is indeed very powerful and it can be very convenient to use when you are dealing with authentication and authorization.

In this Episode of AWS Bites Podcast we try to clarify what is the difference between User Pools and Identity Pools. When to use one or the other and even when to use them together. Throughout the episode, we will cover several practical examples and use cases.

In this episode, we didnâ€™t really mention any resource, but if you want to deep dive on this topic here are some useful links:

- Our series of [live streams where we build a serverless product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfRElTYilyY&list=PLAWXFhe0N1vI1_z-06EzJ22pz95_gBrId) and where we also use Cognito User Pools for authentication.
