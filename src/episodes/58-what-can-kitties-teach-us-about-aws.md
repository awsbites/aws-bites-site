Building actual projects is a great way to consolidate our understanding of AWS. In this episode, we present 4 different project ideas to explore services and concepts in the space of web application development, machine learning, and data science.

Ok, you are probably wondering where kitties come into the equation here. Every one of these 4 project ideas involves kitties! 🐱

We can learn stuff and have some fun too!
