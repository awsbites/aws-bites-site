AWS Lambda is one of the most famous AWS services these days. If you are just starting with your cloud journey you might be confused about what Lambda actually is, what are the limitations, and when you should be using it or not.

In this episode, we provide a beginner-friendly introduction to Lambda and summarise everything thereâ€™s to know about it: when to use it and when not, differences with containers, the pricing model, limitations, and integrations.

By the end of this episode, we will also chime in with some of our opinions and share whether we believe that Lambda is the future of cloud computing or not!
