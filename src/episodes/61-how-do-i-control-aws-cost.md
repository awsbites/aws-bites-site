Let's face it: when it comes to AWS, cost is one of the scariest topics!

Why? Mostly because the underlying model can get very complex.

There are too many variables and ultimately it's just hard to predict how much is a given workload going to cost you on AWS. Are going to be bankrupted by this unpredictable cost? Probably not!

In this episode, we share some suggestions and tools on how to approach cost when going to AWS. It's not a simple topic, but it's something you need to embrace, learn and get confident with. With a bit of effort, cost will not be so scary anymore and you'll be able to take advantage of all the awesome services and features of AWS without being so worried about cost!
