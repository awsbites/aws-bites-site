re:Invent 2022, the biggest AWS conference of the year is just over and there were tons of interesting announcements: many new features and some interesting new AWS products! But we are not going to bother you with yet another walkthrough of all of them. In this episode of AWS Bites podcast we just discuss our top 3 announcements and explained what we liked and what could have made them even better!

We will talk about EventBridge Pipes, Step Functions Distributed Map, and Application Composer.
