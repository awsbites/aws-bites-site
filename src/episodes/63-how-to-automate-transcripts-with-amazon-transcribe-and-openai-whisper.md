We built a Step Function that allows us to generate high-quality transcripts for AWS Bites podcast!

After evaluating different approaches and technologies we ended up using Amazon transcribe and OpenAI whisper. They both have their pros and cons but combined together they gave us everything we were looking for with quite a good degree of accuracy!

In this episode, we describe our use case, our research, and how eventually we did go about productionizing our final solution.

If you run a podcast and you would like to do something similar, we have open source our solution. It's called PodWhisperer and you can find it on GitHub: [github.com/fourTheorem/podwhisperer](https://github.com/fourTheorem/podwhisperer).
