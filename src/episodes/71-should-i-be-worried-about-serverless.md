Join us as we explore the controversy surrounding serverless computing in this week's video! We'll be discussing David Heinemeier Hansson's recent blog post where he argues that serverless is a trap that only benefits cloud providers.

While we respect DHH's opinion, we'll be providing an alternative perspective by analyzing his major points and discussing the benefits of using serverless computing, including Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and increased agility. We'll also be highlighting how serverless can help teams focus on business logic instead of infrastructure management and enable easier integration with other cloud services, making it more efficient to build and deploy applications.

Don't miss out on this informative and thought-provoking discussion!
