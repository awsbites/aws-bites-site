In this special episode of AWS Bites, we drop all our opinions about the sudden growth of AI and how it is going to change the future as we know it!

We begin by taking a trip down memory lane and discovering the types of AI tools that have been used in the past and how they have helped us. Then, we'll dive into ChatGPT, a language model that can assist us in writing and even creating code. We're especially excited to discuss how ChatGPT can be used to create slide decks or even write a book or a blog post.

But wait, there's more! We'll also explore the utility of other AI tools such as Grammarly and OpenAI Whisper for improving our writing and transcribing spoken words into text.

Moving forward, we'll examine how we tried to use AI to develop cloud applications on platforms like AWS. We'll also consider the impact of AI on the education system and how it can be used to modernize complex systems, or for learning, including programming languages that are new to developers.

Now, we know there might be some concerns about using AI, such as whether it takes away the fun of software engineering or reduces creativity. But fear not! We'll address these concerns head-on and explore how AI can actually make us more productive and lead to exciting new discoveries.

Finally, we'll discuss the exciting possibilities for AI and its potential to democratize access to the job market and society in general.

**_A Limerick by ChatGPT_**

_On the Amazon Cloud far away,_  
_Where businesses went to play,_  
_The costs grew so vast,_  
_Their budgets were trashed,_  
_As their dollars all floated away!_
