In this episode of the AWS Bites podcast, we discuss the challenges of hosting private static websites on AWS.

We explore why it's important to host internal corporate applications and line of business applications only for internal consumption, and the requirements for doing so. 

We also evaluate different options for hosting private static websites, including S3 with CloudFront, containers on ECS/Fargate with ALB, API Gateway, and AppRunner. 

Finally, we summarize the pros and cons of each option and provide a rating for each.

If you're looking to host a private static website on AWS, this episode is a must-listen!
