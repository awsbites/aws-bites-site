Who is the king of all databases when it comes to performance? Yes, Redis! Of course!

In this episode of AWS Bites, we talk about Redis on ElastiCache, one of the most essential instruments in the cloud architect's toolbox.

We explore the joys and woes of Redis on AWS and share some exciting alternatives regarding in-memory databases and caching systems.

We discuss the use cases of Redis, including session storage, web page caching, database cache, cost optimization, queues and pub/sub messaging, and distributed applications state.

We extensively talk about ElastiCache, the managed cache solution on AWS based on either Redis or Memcache, and its features such as replication groups, auto-scaling, and monitoring. 

Finally, we discuss potential alternatives, such as DynamoDB (with DAX), Upstash, or Momento, a serverless cache built on Pelikan.
