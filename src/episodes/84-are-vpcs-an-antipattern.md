In this episode of AWS Bites, we explore the future of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in the context of the zero-trust security trend.

We'll dive into the pros and cons of using VPCs, including their usefulness when dealing with sensitive data or when you need fine-grained control over your network environment. But let's be real, sometimes VPCs can be a bit of a headache. We'll discuss why you might want to avoid them, including the added complexity they can bring to your network environment.

Fear not, we'll also provide a summary of when to use and when not to use VPCs, as well as alternatives to using VPCs, such as services that don't require them.

So, are ready to talk VPCs!?
