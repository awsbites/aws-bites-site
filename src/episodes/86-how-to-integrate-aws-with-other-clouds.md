Are you struggling with securely integrating workloads running on-premises, in Azure, or in any other cloud with a workload running in AWS? 

In this exciting episode of the AWS Bites podcast, we dive into 6 different options for securely and efficiently integrating workloads between clouds. From providing a public API in AWS with an authorization method to using IAM roles anywhere to using OIDC federated identities, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of each option. We even cover the use of SSM hybrid activations and creating the interface on the Azure/Data Centre side and polling from AWS.

Don't miss out on this informative discussion about the best practices for integrating workloads between clouds. Tune in now and letâ€™s have some cloud fun together!
