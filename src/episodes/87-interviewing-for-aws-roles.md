Are you interested in landing an AWS role? Or maybe are you looking to hire some cloud talent?!

In this episode of the AWS Bites podcast, we share our insights on the interview process we have adopted at fourTheorem.

This process is not just about testing AWS knowledge, but it's also about evaluating cultural fit, way of working skills and knowledge, and future plans.

From the “Fiona chat” to the technical interview, we provide valuable tips for candidates, such as being honest about your knowledge and asking questions during the interview.
