In this episode, we take a journey through time and technology and learn the origin stories of Eoin and Luciano. In this captivating discussion, they share their paths into the world of software development and their eventual immersion into the realm of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Eoin's story begins in the early days of home computing, where he tinkered with a Spectrum ZX, coding programs and saving them on audio cassettes. He walks us through his computer science studies, securing his first jobs, and his initial encounters with AWS, where skepticism eventually turned into fascination.

Meanwhile, Luciano shares his first magical encounter with a computer, igniting his passion for programming, and his subsequent journey into computer science and early work experiences. Moving to Ireland opened doors to work on pioneering cloud projects, leading him to develop tools like Middy and eventually join fourTheorem.

The episode delves into their experiences with serverless architecture, solo startups, and how they would approach learning differently if given the chance to do it all again.

Join us for a nostalgic, inspiring, and educational episode as we explore the captivating stories that shaped our expertise in the world of AWS.
