In this episode of AWS Bites, we take you on a captivating migration journey. Together, we'll explore how we transformed fullstackbulletin.com's automation process, leaving behind the complexities of a monolithic AWS Lambda and embracing the efficiency of Step Functions.

Join us as we dive into the challenges of automating a weekly newsletter, trying to strike the perfect balance between automation and manual curation. We'll discover the risks of relying on external services and how we navigated these obstacles during our migration.

Together, we'll uncover the step-by-step process of breaking down the monolithic Lambda architecture and orchestrating a more manageable approach with Step Functions. We will also briefly touch on alternative social platforms like Mastodon and other Twitter alternatives during our migration adventure.

Learn with us about different migration strategies and the crucial role of observability for smooth operations. Finally, we will share some valuable lessons that you can apply to your production workloads.
